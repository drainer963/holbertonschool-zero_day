      "body": "We strongly recommend using a time-based one-time password (TOTP) application to configure 2FA. TOTP applications are more reliable than SMS, especially for locations outside the United States. TOTP apps support the secure backup of your authentication codes in the cloud and can be restored if you lose access to your device.  In this guide  Configuring two-factor authentication using a TOTP mobile app Configuring two-factor authentication using text messages Configuring two-factor authentication using FIDO U2F   Warning:  If you're a member, billing manager, or outside collaborator to a private repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication, you must leave the organization before you can disable 2FA on GitHub. If you disable 2FA, you will automatically lose access to the organization and any private forks you have of the organization's private repositories. To regain access to the organization and your forks, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.    Configuring two-factor authentication using a TOTP mobile app A time-based one-time password (TOTP) application automatically generates an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time. We recommend using cloud-based TOTP apps such as:  1Password Authy LastPass Authenticator   Tip: To configure authentication via TOTP on multiple devices, during setup, scan the QR code using each device at the same time. If 2FA is already enabled and you want to add another device, you must re-configure 2FA from your security settings.   Download a TOTP app. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.   In the user settings sidebar, click Security.  Under \"Two-factor authentication\", click Enable two-factor authentication.  On the Two-factor authentication page, click Set up using an app. Save your recovery codes in a safe place. Your recovery codes can help you get back into your account if you lose access.  To save your recovery codes on your device, click Download. To save a hard copy of your recovery codes, click Print. To copy your recovery codes for storage in a password manager, click Copy.     After saving your two-factor recovery codes, click Next.  On the Two-factor authentication page, do one of the following:  Scan the QR code with your mobile device's app. After scanning, the app displays a six-digit code that you can enter on GitHub. If you can't scan the QR code, click enter this text code to see a code you can copy and manually enter on GitHub instead. If you're using Microsoft Authenticator, you'll need to use this method.     The TOTP mobile application saves your GitHub account and generates a new authentication code every few seconds. On GitHub, on the 2FA page, type the code and click Enable.   After you've saved your recovery codes and enabled 2FA, we recommend you sign out and back in to your account. In case of problems, such as a forgotten password or typo in your email address, you can use recovery codes to access your account and correct the problem.   Configuring two-factor authentication using text messages If you're unable to authenticate using a TOTP mobile app, you can authenticate using SMS messages. You can also provide a second number for a fallback device. If you lose access to both your primary device and your recovery codes, a backup SMS number can get you back in to your account. Before using this method, be sure that you can receive text messages. Carrier rates may apply.  Warning: We strongly recommend using a TOTP application for two-factor authentication instead of SMS. GitHub doesn't support sending SMS messages to phones in every country. Before configuring authentication via text message, review the list of countries where GitHub supports authentication via SMS. For more information, see \"Countries where SMS authentication is supported\".   In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.   In the user settings sidebar, click Security.  Under \"Two-factor authentication\", click Enable two-factor authentication.  On the Two-factor authentication page, click Set up using SMS. Save your recovery codes in a safe place. Your recovery codes can help you get back into your account if you lose access.  To save your recovery codes on your device, click Download. To save a hard copy of your recovery codes, click Print. To copy your recovery codes for storage in a password manager, click Copy.     After saving your two-factor recovery codes, click Next. Select your country code and type your mobile phone number, including the area code. When your information is correct, click Send authentication code.  You'll receive a text message with a security code. Type the code on the Two-factor authentication page, and click Enable.   After you've saved your recovery codes and enabled 2FA, we recommend you sign out and back in to your account. In case of problems, such as a forgotten password or typo in your email address, you can use recovery codes to access your account and correct the problem.   Configuring two-factor authentication using FIDO U2F After you configure 2FA via a TOTP mobile app or via SMS, you can add a security key that supports the FIDO U2F standard to use for two-factor authentication on GitHub. Authentication with a security key is secondary to authentication with a TOTP application or a text message. If you lose your hardware key, you'll still be able to use your phone's code to sign in.  Tip: FIDO U2F authentication is currently only available for the Chrome browser.   You must have already configured 2FA via a TOTP mobile app or via SMS. Download and install Google Authenticator. Ensure that you have a FIDO U2F compatible security key inserted into your computer. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.   In the user settings sidebar, click Security.  Next to \"Security keys\", click Add.  Under \"Security keys\", click Register new device.   Type a nickname for the security key, then click Add.   When prompted, touch your security key to have it authenticate against GitHub.   If you're authenticating to GitHub on an Android phone, you can use your FIDO U2F compatible security key and Google Authenticator to sign into your account with Near Field Communication (NFC).  Confirm that you've downloaded and can access your recovery codes. If you haven't already, or if you'd like to generate another set of codes, download your codes and save them in a safe place. If you lose access to your account, you can use your recovery codes to get back into your account. For more information, see \"Recovering your account if you lose your 2FA credentials.\"   After you've saved your recovery codes and enabled 2FA, we recommend you sign out and back in to your account. In case of problems, such as a forgotten password or typo in your email address, you can use recovery codes to access your account and correct the problem.

Make sure you really want to commit to this branch.   Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.  In the \"Pull Requests\" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.  Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts.   Tip: If the Resolve conflicts button is deactivated, your pull request's merge conflict is too complex to resolve on GitHub.

For more information, see \"Creating a pull request from a fork\" and \"About forks.\"  Note: To open a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull request.  You can close corresponding issues using a keyword in your pull request or commit message. For more information, see \"Closing issues using keywords.\"  Changing the branch range and destination repository By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.  When thinking about branches, remember that the base branch is where changes should be applied, the head branch contains what you would like to be applied. When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in. When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.  Tips:  Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see \"Comparing commits across time.\" Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see \"About issue and pull request templates.\"    Creating the pull request  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. In the \"Branch\" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.  To the right of the Branch menu, click New pull request.  Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.  Type a title and description for your pull request.  Click Create pull request.    Tip: After you create a pull request, you can ask a specific person to review your proposed changes. For more information, see \"Requesting a pull request review.\"  After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be merged into the repository.

      "body": " Note: When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:  If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request. While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes. When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push. Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.   After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams. For more information, see \"Creating a pull request.\"  Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the \"Files changed\" tab. Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request. You can see information about the branch's current deployment status and past deployment activity on the \"Conversation\" tab. For more information, see \"Viewing deployment activity for a repository.\" After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request. If you're working in a shared repository model, the proposed changes will be merged from the head branch to the base branch that was specified in the pull request. For more information, see \"Merging a pull request.\" If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see \"About required status checks.\" You can close corresponding issues using a keyword in your pull request or commit message.

If your site is a User or Organization Page that has a repository named &lt;username&gt;.github.io or &lt;orgname&gt;.github.io , you cannot publish your site's source files from different locations. User and Organization Pages that have this type of repository name are only published from the master branch. For more information about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\"  Default source settings for repositories without the username naming scheme The default settings for publishing your site's source files depend on your site type and the branches you have in your site repository. If your site repository doesn't have a master or gh-pages branch, your GitHub Pages publishing source is set to None and your site is not published.  After you've created either a master or gh-pages branch, you can set one as your publishing source so that your site will be published. If you fork or upload your site repository with only a master or gh-pages branch, your site's source setting will automatically be enabled for that branch.  Enabling GitHub Pages to publish your site from master or gh-pages  To select master or gh-pages as your publishing source, you must have the branch present in your repository. If you don't have a master or gh-pages branch, you can create them and then return to source settings to change your publishing source.  On GitHub, navigate to your GitHub Pages site's repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings.  Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.  Click Save.     Publishing your GitHub Pages site from a /docs folder on your master branch To publish your site's source files from a /docs folder on your master branch, you must have a master branch and your repository must:  have a /docs folder in the root of the repository not follow the repository naming scheme &lt;username&gt;.github.io or &lt;orgname&gt;.github.io   GitHub Pages will read everything to publish your site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. For example, when you edit your custom domain through the GitHub Pages settings, the custom domain will write to /docs/CNAME.  Tip: If you remove the /docs folder from the master branch after it's enabled, your site won't build and you'll get a page build error message for a missing /docs folder.   On GitHub, navigate to your GitHub Pages site's repository. Create a folder in the root of your repository on the master branch called /docs. Under your repository name, click  Settings.   Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master branch /docs folder as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

      "body": "The git filter-branch command and the BFG Repo-Cleaner rewrite your repository's history, which changes the SHAs for existing commits that you alter and any dependent commits. Changed commit SHAs may affect open pull requests in your repository. We recommend merging or closing all open pull requests before removing files from your repository. You can remove the file from the latest commit with git rm. For information on removing a file that was added with the latest commit, see \"Removing files from a repository's history.\"  Warning: Once you have pushed a commit to GitHub, you should consider any data it contains to be compromised. If you committed a password, change it! If you committed a key, generate a new one. This article tells you how to make commits with sensitive data unreachable from any branches or tags in your GitHub repository. However, it's important to note that those commits may still be accessible in any clones or forks of your repository, directly via their SHA-1 hashes in cached views on GitHub, and through any pull requests that reference them. You can't do anything about existing clones or forks of your repository, but you can permanently remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests on GitHub by contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.   Purging a file from your repository's history  Using the BFG The BFG Repo-Cleaner is a tool that's built and maintained by the open source community. It provides a faster, simpler alternative to git filter-branch for removing unwanted data. For example, to remove your file with sensitive data and leave your latest commit untouched, run:  bfg --delete-files YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA  To replace all text listed in passwords.txt wherever it can be found in your repository's history, run:  bfg --replace-text passwords.txt  See the BFG Repo-Cleaner's documentation for full usage and download instructions.  Using filter-branch  Warning: If you run git filter-branch after stashing changes, you won't be able to retrieve your changes with other stash commands. Before running git filter-branch, we recommend unstashing any changes you've made. To unstash the last set of changes you've stashed, run git stash show -p | git apply -R. For more information, see Git Tools Stashing.  To illustrate how git filter-branch works, we'll show you how to remove your file with sensitive data from the history of your repository and add it to .gitignore to ensure that it is not accidentally re-committed.   If you don't already have a local copy of your repository with sensitive data in its history, clone the repository to your local computer.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/YOUR-FILE-PATH/YOUR-REPOSITORY/.git/ remote: Counting objects: 1301, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (769/769), done. remote: Total 1301 (delta 724), reused 910 (delta 522) Receiving objects: 100% (1301/1301), 164.39 KiB, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (724/724), done.    Navigate into the repository's working directory.  cd YOUR-REPOSITORY    Run the following command, replacing PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA with the path to the file you want to remove, not just its filename. These arguments will:  Force Git to process, but not check out, the entire history of every branch and tag Remove the specified file, as well as any empty commits generated as a result  Overwrite your existing tags  git filter-branch --force --index-filter \\ 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA' \\ --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all Rewrite 48dc599c80e20527ed902928085e7861e6b3cbe6 (266/266) Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten     Note: If the file with sensitive data used to exist at any other paths (because it was moved or renamed), you must run this command on those paths, as well.    Add your file with sensitive data to .gitignore to ensure that you don't accidentally commit it again.  echo \"YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA\" &gt;&gt; .gitignore git add .gitignore git commit -m \"Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore\" [master 051452f] Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore  1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)   Double-check that you've removed everything you wanted to from your repository's history, and that all of your branches are checked out.  Once you're happy with the state of your repository, force-push your local changes to overwrite your GitHub repository, as well as all the branches you've pushed up:  git push origin --force --all Counting objects: 1074, done. Delta compression using 2 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (677/677), done. Writing objects: 100% (1058/1058), 148.85 KiB, done.

Delta compression using up to 8 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (166/166), done. Writing objects: 100% (321/321), 331.74 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. Total 321 (delta 124), reused 269 (delta 108) To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git  + 48dc599...051452f master -&gt; master (forced update)   Contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support, asking them to remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests on GitHub. Tell your collaborators to rebase, not merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history. One merge commit could reintroduce some or all of the tainted history that you just went to the trouble of purging.  After some time has passed and you're confident that git filter-branch had no unintended side effects, you can force all objects in your local repository to be dereferenced and garbage collected with the following commands (using Git 1.8.5 or newer):  git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin git reflog expire --expire=now --all git gc --prune=now Counting objects: 2437, done. Delta compression using up to 4 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (1378/1378), done. Writing objects: 100% (2437/2437), done. Total 2437 (delta 1461), reused 1802 (delta 1048)   Note: You can also achieve this by pushing your filtered history to a new or empty repository and then making a fresh clone from GitHub.     Avoiding accidental commits in the future There are a few simple tricks to avoid committing things you don't want committed:  Use a visual program like GitHub Desktop or gitk to commit changes. Visual programs generally make it easier to see exactly which files will be added, deleted, and modified with each commit. Avoid the catch-all commands git add . and git commit -a on the command line—use git add filename and git rm filename to individually stage files, instead. Use git add --interactive to individually review and stage changes within each file. Use git diff --cached to review the changes that you have staged for commit. This is the exact diff that git commit will produce as long as you don't use the -a flag.   Further reading  git filter-branch main page Pro Git: Git Tools - Rewriting History ",

Adding or changing a passphrase You can change the passphrase for an existing private key without regenerating the keypair by typing the following command:  ssh-keygen -p # Start the SSH key creation process Enter file in which the key is (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Hit enter] Key has comment '/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa' Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type new passphrase] Enter same passphrase again: [One more time for luck] Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.  If your key already has a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it before you can change to a new passphrase.   Auto-launching ssh-agent on Git for Windows If you're using Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, you don't need to follow these steps. GitHub Desktop automatically launches ssh-agent for you. Otherwise, follow these steps to run ssh-agent automatically when you open bash or Git shell.

      "body": "By RSVP'ing or attending a GitHub event, including any of the events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the GitHub event (collectively the \"Event\"), you signal that you have read, understand, and agree to the following Event Terms and Conditions.  1. Basic requirements to attend - including the Event Code of Conduct  In order to participate in the Event, you represent that  you have the requisite power and authority to enter into these Event Terms you have read and understood these Event Terms as well as the GitHub.com Terms of Service you agree to abide by the Event Code of Conduct, which seeks to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone if alcohol is being served at a GitHub event, you represent that you are at least 21 years old, or otherwise over the legal drinking age in your jurisdiction.  Participants asked to stop any harassing or other prohibited behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in behavior that violates the Event Code of Conduct or these Terms, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or conference with no refund.  2. Pictures GitHub or its partners sometimes take photos and videos at GitHub events. By participating or attending the Event, you agree that you may appear in some of these photos and videos, and you authorize GitHub's use of them. On the flip side, if you take any photos or videos of attendees at the Event and provide them to us, you authorize us to use them in the same fashion, and represent that the attendees that appear in your photos and videos have also consented to such use.  3. Risk, liability, and indemnity  Assumption of risk Although we try to create a safe environment at the Event, accidents or other bad things happen, even to good people. We ask that you do your part to help limit the possibility that you might get injured at the Event. You agree to carefully consider the risks inherent in any activities that you choose to take part in and to take reasonable precautions before you choose to attend or participate at a GitHub event. For example, you should ensure that you are in good physical health before engaging in any physical activity at a GitHub event, and you should always drink responsibly given the risks associated with drunk driving and participating in activities while your judgment is impaired. It's always good to remember that other event guests may be less responsible than you, and may themselves create additional risk to you despite their best intentions. In short, you understand that your attendance and participation at any GitHub event is voluntary, and you agree to assume responsibility for any resulting injuries to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. By the same token, you agree that GitHub is not responsible for any injuries or accidents that you might sustain at any events that GitHub doesn't organize or control.  Release of liability You (for yourself, your heirs, personal representatives, or assigns, and anyone else who might make a claim on your behalf) hereby release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue GitHub and its respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, members, agents, employees, vendors, sponsors, and volunteers from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses or expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to your attendance at the Event or any related event, except, of course, for any gross negligence or willful misconduct on our part.  Indemnity By the same token, you agree to indemnify and hold GitHub, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives harmless, including costs, liabilities and legal fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to, related to, or connected with your attendance or conduct at the Event or any related event.  4. Termination While we hope not to, GitHub may prohibit your attendance at any GitHub event at any time if you fail to abide by these Event Terms and the Event Code of Conduct, the GitHub.com Terms of Service, or for any or no reason, without notice or liability of any kind. Section 4 will continue to apply following any termination.  5. Choice of law and venue California law will govern these Event Terms, as well as any claim, cause of action or dispute that might arise between you and GitHub (a \"Claim\"), without regard to conflict of law provisions. FOR ANY CLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.  6. Miscellaneous terms You agree that you will not represent yourself as an employee, representative, or agent of GitHub (unless, of course, you are actually employed by GitHub). We reserve the right to cancel the Event or any related event at any time, for any reason, and without liability or prejudice. Any failure on GitHub's part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Event Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.",

      "category": "Site Policy",
      "category_url": "/categories/site-policy",
      "url": "/articles/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data",
      "body": "Are you a law enforcement officer conducting an investigation that may involve user content hosted on GitHub? Or maybe you're a privacy-conscious person who would like to know what information we share with law enforcement and under what circumstances. Either way, you're on the right page. In these guidelines, we provide a little background about what GitHub is, the types of data we have, and the conditions under which we will disclose private user information. Before we get into the details, however, here are a few important details you may want to know:  We will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We will not disclose location-tracking data, such as IP address logs, without a valid court order or search warrant. We will not disclose any private user content, including the contents of private repositories, without a valid search warrant.   About these guidelines Our users trust us with their software projects and code—often some of their most valuable business or personal assets. Maintaining that trust is essential to us, which means keeping user data safe, secure, and private. While the overwhelming majority of our users use GitHub's services to create new businesses, build new technologies, and for the general betterment of humankind, we recognize that with millions of users spread all over the world, there are bound to be a few bad apples in the bunch. In those cases, we want to help law enforcement serve their legitimate interest in protecting the public. By providing guidelines for law enforcement personnel, we hope to strike a balance between the often competing interests of user privacy and justice. We hope these guidelines will help to set expectations on both sides, as well as to add transparency to GitHub's internal processes. Our users should know that we value their private information and that we do what we can to protect it. At a minimum, this means only releasing data to third-parties when the appropriate legal requirements have been satisfied. By the same token, we also hope to educate law enforcement professionals about GitHub's systems so that they can more efficiently tailor their data requests and target just that information needed to conduct their investigation.  GitHub terminology Before asking us to disclose data, it may be useful to understand how our system is implemented. GitHub hosts millions of data repositories using the Git version control system. Repositories on GitHub—which may be public or private—are most commonly used for software development projects, but are also often used to work on content of all kinds.  Users — Users are represented in our system as personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories. Users can create or be invited to join organizations or to collaborate on another user's repository. Collaborators — A collaborator is a user with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner. Organizations — Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations, such as businesses or projects. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams of users. Repositories — A repository is one of the most basic GitHub elements. They may be easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and, at its administrators' discretion, may be publicly viewable or not. Pages — GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted by GitHub that users can easily publish through code stored in their repositories. If a user or organization has a GitHub Page, it can usually be found at a URL such as https://username.github.io or they may have the webpage mapped to their own custom domain name. Gists — Gists are snippets of source code or other text that users can use to store ideas or share with friends. Like regular GitHub repositories, Gists are created with Git, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and downloadable. Gists can either be public or secret (accessible only through a known URL). Public Gists cannot be converted into secret Gists.   User data on GitHub.com Here is a non-exhaustive list of the kinds of data we maintain about users and projects on GitHub.    Public account data — There is a variety of information publicly available on GitHub about users and their repositories. User profiles can be found at a URL such as https://github.com/username. User profiles display information about when the user created their account as well their public activity on GitHub.com and social interactions. Public user profiles can also include additional information that a user may have chosen to share publicly. All user public profiles display:  Username The repositories that the user has starred The other GitHub users the user follows The users that follow them  Optionally, a user may also choose to share the following information publicly:  Their real name An avatar An affiliated company Their location A public email address Their personal web page Organizations to which the user is a member (depending on either the organizations' or the users' preferences)     Private account data — GitHub also collects and maintains certain private information about users as outlined in our Privacy Policy. This may include:  Private email addresses Payment details Security access logs Data about interactions with private repositories  To get a sense of the type of private account information that GitHub collects, you can visit your personal dashboard and browse through the sections in the left-hand menubar.    Public repository data — GitHub is home to millions of public, open-source software projects. You can browse almost any public repository (for example, the Atom Project) to get a sense for the information that GitHub collects and maintains about repositories. This can include:  The code itself Previous versions of the code Stable release versions of the project Information about collaborators, contributors and repository members Logs of Git operations such as commits, branching, pushing, pulling, forking and cloning Conversations related to Git operations such as comments on pull requests or commits Project documentation such as Issues and Wiki pages Statistics and graphs showing contributions to the project and the network of contributors    Private repository data — GitHub collects and maintains the same type of data for private repositories that can be seen for public repositories, except only specifically invited users may access private repository data.  Other data — Additionally, GitHub collects analytics data such as page visits and information occasionally volunteered by our users (such as communications with our support team, survey information and/or site registrations).   We will notify any affected account owners It is our policy to notify users about any pending requests regarding their accounts or repositories, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so. Before disclosing user information, we will make a reasonable effort to notify any affected account owner(s) by sending a message to their verified email address providing them with a copy of the subpoena, court order, or warrant so that they can have an opportunity to challenge the legal process if they wish. In (rare) exigent circumstances, we may delay notification if we determine delay is necessary to prevent death or serious harm.  Disclosure of non-public information It is our policy to disclose non-public user information in connection with a civil or criminal investigation only with user consent or upon receipt of a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order, search warrant, or other similar valid legal process. In certain exigent circumstances (see below), we also may share limited information but only corresponding to the nature of the circumstances, and would require legal process for anything beyond that. GitHub reserves the right to object to any requests for non-public information. Where GitHub agrees to produce non-public information in response to a lawful request, we will conduct a reasonable search for the requested information. Here are the kinds of information we will agree to produce, depending on the kind of legal process we are served with:   With user consent — GitHub will provide private account information, if requested, directly to the user (or an owner, in the case of an organization account), or to a designated third party with the user's written consent once GitHub is satisfied that the user has verified his or her identity.   With a subpoena — If served with a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar legal process issued in connection with an official criminal or civil investigation, we can provide certain non-public account information, which may include:  Name(s) associated with the account Email address(es) associated with the account Billing information Registration date and termination date IP address, date, and time at the time of account registration IP address(es) used to access the account at a specified time or event relevant to the investigation  Please note that the information available will vary from case to case. Some of the information is optional for users to provide. In other cases, we might not have collected or retained the information.    With a court order or a search warrant — We will not disclose account access logs unless compelled to do so by either (i) a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), upon a showing of specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation; or (ii) a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, upon a showing of probable cause. Account access logs may include:  Any logs which would reveal a user's movements over a period of time Account or private repository settings (for example, which users have certain permissions, etc.) User- or IP-specific analytic data such as browsing history Security access logs other than account creation or for a specific time and date     Only with a search warrant — We will not disclose the private contents of any user account unless compelled to do so under a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause. Private user account contents may include:  Contents of secret Gists Source code or other content in private repositories Contribution and collaboration records for private repositories Communications or documentation (such as Issues or Wikis) in private repositories    Under exigent circumstances — If we receive a request for information under certain exigent circumstances (where we believe the disclosure is necessary to prevent an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person), we may disclose limited information that we determine necessary to enable law enforcement to address the emergency. For any information beyond that, we would require a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, as described above. For example, we will not disclose contents of private repositories without a search warrant. Before disclosing information, we confirm that the request came from a law enforcement agency, an authority sent an official notice summarizing the emergency, and how the information requested will assist in addressing the emergency.   Cost reimbursement We reserve the right to seek reimbursement for administrative costs associated with responding to requests for information, as allowed by law.  Data preservation We will take steps to preserve account records for up to 90 days upon formal request from U.S. law enforcement in connection with official criminal investigations, and pending the issuance of a court order or other process.  Submitting requests Please serve requests to: GitHub, Inc. c/o Incorporating Services, Ltd. 7801 Folsom Boulevard Suite 202 Sacramento, CA 95826  You may also send a courtesy copy to legal@support.github.com. Please make your requests as specific and narrow as possible, including the following information:  Full information about authority issuing the request for information The name and badge/ID of the responsible agent An official email address and contact phone number The user, organization, repository name(s) of interest The URLs of any pages, gists or files of interest The description of the types of records you need  Please allow at least two weeks for us to be able to look into your request.  Requests from foreign law enforcement As a United States company based in California, GitHub is not required to provide data to foreign governments in response to legal process issued by foreign authorities. Foreign law enforcement officials wishing to request information from GitHub should contact the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs. GitHub will promptly respond to requests that are issued via U.S. court by way of a mutual legal assistance treaty (“MLAT”) or letter rogatory.

Only owners can access an organization's audit log.  In the top right corner of GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Your profile.  On the left side of your profile page, under \"Organizations\", click the icon for your organization.  Under your organization name, click  Settings.  In the Settings sidebar, click Audit log.    Searching the audit log The audit log lists the following information about actions made within your organization:  Which repository an action was performed in The user that performed the action The action that was performed Which country the action took place in The date and time the action occurred  Note that you cannot search for audit entries using text. You can, however, construct search queries using a variety of filters. Many operators used when querying the audit log—such as -, &gt;, or &lt; —match the same format as searching across GitHub.  Search based on repository Use the repo qualifier to limit actions to a specific repository owned by your organization. For example:   repo:my-org/our-repo finds all events that occurred for the our-repo repository in the my-org organization.  repo:my-org/our-repo repo:my-org/another-repo finds all events that occurred for both the our-repo and another-repo repositories in the my-org organization.  -repo:my-org/not-this-repo excludes all events that occurred for the not-this-repo repository in the my-org organization.  Note that you must include your organization's name within the repo qualifier; searching for just repo:our-repo will not work.  Search based on the user The actor qualifier can scope events based on the member of your organization that performed the action. For example:   actor:octocat finds all events performed by octocat.  actor:octocat actor:hubot finds all events performed by both octocat and hubot.  -actor:hubot excludes all events performed by hubot.  Note that you can only use a GitHub username, not an individual's real name.  Search based on the action performed To search for specific events, use the action qualifier in your query. Actions listed in the audit log are grouped within the following categories:    Category Name Description     account Contains all activities related to your organization account.   billing Contains all activities related to your organization's billing.   discussion_post Contains all activities related to discussions posted to a team page.   discussion_post_reply Contains all activities related to replies to discussions posted to a team page.   hook Contains all activities related to webhooks.   integration_installation_request Contains all activities related to organization member requests for owners to approve integrations for use in the organization.   marketplace_agreement_signature Contains all activities related to signing the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement.   marketplace_listing Contains all activities related to listing apps in GitHub Marketplace.   org Contains all activities related organization membership   payment_method Contains all activities related to how your organization pays for GitHub.   profile_picture Contains all activities related to your organization's profile picture.   project Contains all activities related to project boards.   protected_branch Contains all activities related to protected branches.   repo Contains all activities related to the repositories owned by your organization.   repository_content_analysis Contains all activities related to enabling or disabling data use for a private repository.   repository_dependency_graph Contains all activities related to enabling or disabling the dependency graph for a private repository.   repository_vulnerability_alert Contains all activities related to security alerts for vulnerable dependencies.   team Contains all activities related to teams in your organization.   team_discussions Contains activities related to managing team discussions for an organization.    You can search for specific sets of actions using these terms. For example:   action:team finds all events grouped within the team category.  -action:hook excludes all events in the webhook category.  Each category has a set of associated events that you can filter on. For example:   action:team.create finds all events where a team was created.  -action:hook.events_changed excludes all events where the events on a webhook have been altered.  This list describes the available categories and associated events:  The account category The billing category The discussion_post category The discussion_post_reply category The hook category The integration_installation_request category The issue category The marketplace_agreement_signature category The marketplace_listing category The org category The oauth_application category The payment_method category The profile_picture category The project category The protected_branch category The repo category The repository_content_analysis category The repository_dependency_graph category The repository_vulnerability_alert category The team category The team_discussions category   The account category    Action Description     billing_plan_change Triggered when an organization's billing cycle changes.   plan_change Triggered when an organization's subscription changes.   pending_plan_change Triggered when an organization owner or billing manager cancels or downgrades a paid subscription.   pending_subscription_change Triggered when a GitHub Marketplace free trial starts or expires.

Search based on time of action Use the created qualifier to filter actions in the audit log based on when they occurred. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).  Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:   created:2014-07-08 finds all events that occurred on July 8th, 2014.  created:&gt;=2014-07-08 finds all events that occurred on or after July 8th, 2014.  created:&lt;=2014-07-08 finds all events that occurred on or before July 8th, 2014.  created:2014-07-01..2014-07-31 finds all events that occurred in the month of July 2014.  The audit log contains data for the past 90 days, but you can use the created qualifier to search for events earlier than that.  Search based on location Using the qualifier country, you can filter actions in the audit log based on the originating country. You can use a country's two-letter short code or its full name. Keep in mind that countries with spaces in their name will need to be wrapped in quotation marks. For example:   country:de finds all events that occurred in Germany.  country:Mexico finds all events that occurred in Mexico.  country:\"United States\" all finds events that occurred in the United States.   Exporting the audit log You can export your organization's audit log as JSON data or a comma-separated value (CSV) file, with or without a specified search.  When exporting the results of a specific search, these fields can be included:    key example value     action team.create   actor dewski   user shayfrendt   org octo-org   repo octo-org/documentation   created_at 1429548104000 (Timestamp shows the time since Epoch with milliseconds.)   data.hook_id 245   data.events [\"issues\", \"issue_comment\", \"pull_request\", \"pull_request_review_comment\"]   data.events_were [\"push\", \"pull_request\", \"issues\"]   data.target_login octocat   data.old_user hubot   data.team octo-org/engineering     Further reading  \"Keeping your organization secure\" ",

      "body": " Use git push to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.  The git push command takes two arguments:  A remote name, for example, origin  A branch name, for example, master   For example:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;BRANCHNAME&gt;   As an example, you usually run git push origin master to push your local changes to your online repository.  Renaming branches To rename a branch, you'd use the same git push command, but you would add one more argument: the name of the new branch. For example:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;LOCALBRANCHNAME&gt;:&lt;REMOTEBRANCHNAME&gt;   This pushes the LOCALBRANCHNAME to your REMOTENAME, but it is renamed to REMOTEBRANCHNAME.  Dealing with \"non-fast-forward\" errors If your local copy of a repository is out of sync with, or \"behind,\" the upstream repository you're pushing to, you'll get a message saying non-fast-forward updates were rejected. This means that you must retrieve, or \"fetch,\" the upstream changes, before you are able to push your local changes. For more information on this error, see \"Dealing with non-fast-forward errors.\"  Pushing tags By default, and without additional parameters, git push sends all matching branches that have the same names as remote branches. To push a single tag, you can issue the same command as pushing a branch:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;TAGNAME&gt;   To push all your tags, you can type the command:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; --tags   Deleting a remote branch or tag The syntax to delete a branch is a bit arcane at first glance:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; :&lt;BRANCHNAME&gt;   Note that there is a space before the colon. The command resembles the same steps you'd take to rename a branch. However, here, you're telling Git to push nothing into BRANCHNAME on REMOTENAME. Because of this, git push deletes the branch on the remote repository.  Remotes and forks You might already know that you can \"fork\" repositories on GitHub. When you clone a repository you own, you provide it with a remote URL that tells Git where to fetch and push updates. If you want to collaborate with the original repository, you'd add a new remote URL, typically called upstream, to your local Git clone:  git remote add upstream  &lt;THEIR_REMOTE_URL&gt;   Now, you can fetch updates and branches from their fork:  git fetch upstream # Grab the upstream remote's branches remote: Counting objects: 75, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done. remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9) Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done. From https://github.com/octocat/repo  * [new branch] master -&gt; upstream/master  When you're done making local changes, you can push your local branch to GitHub and initiate a pull request.

      "url": "/articles/dmca-takedown-policy",
      "body": "Welcome to GitHub's Guide to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, commonly known as the \"DMCA.\" This page is not meant as a comprehensive primer to the statute. However, if you've received a DMCA takedown notice targeting content you've posted on GitHub or if you're a rights-holder looking to issue such a notice, this page will hopefully help to demystify the law a bit as well as our policies for complying with it. (If you just want to submit a notice, you can skip to the end.) As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.  What Is the DMCA? In order to understand the DMCA and some of the policy lines it draws, it's perhaps helpful to consider life before it was enacted. The DMCA provides a safe harbor for service providers that host user-generated content. Since even a single claim of copyright infringement can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000, the possibility of being held liable for user-generated content could be very harmful for service providers. With potential damages multiplied across millions of users, cloud-computing and user-generated content sites like YouTube, Facebook, or GitHub probably never would have existed without the DMCA (or at least not without passing some of that cost downstream to their users). The DMCA addresses this issue by creating a copyright liability safe harbor for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content. Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright infringement based on user-generated content. Because of this, it is important for GitHub to maintain its DMCA safe-harbor status.  DMCA Notices In a Nutshell The DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all GitHub users should know about: (i) a takedown-notice procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a counter-notice procedure for users to get content reenabled when content is taken down by mistake or misidentification. DMCA takedown notices are used by copyright owners to ask GitHub to take down content they believe to be infringing. If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day. If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on GitHub you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed. On the other hand, counter notices can be used to correct mistakes. Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. Since GitHub usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up. The DMCA notice and takedown process should be used only for complaints about copyright infringement. Notices sent through our DMCA process must identify copyrighted work or works that are allegedly being infringed. The process cannot be used for other complaints, such as complaints about alleged trademark infringement or sensitive data; we offer separate processes for those situations.  A. How Does This Actually Work? The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class. The copyright owner hands GitHub a complaint about a user. If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user. If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so. GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury. Here are the basic steps in the process.   Copyright Owner Investigates. A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm both (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on GitHub is unauthorized and infringing. This includes confirming that the use is not protected as fair use. A particular use may be fair if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately.  Example: An employee of Acme Web Company finds some of the company's code in a GitHub repository. Acme Web Company licenses its source code out to several trusted partners. Before sending in a take-down notice, Acme should review those licenses and its agreements to confirm that the code on GitHub is not authorized under any of them.   Copyright Owner Sends A Notice. After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a takedown notice to GitHub. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the how-to guide), we will post the notice to our public repository and pass the link along to the affected user. GitHub Asks User to Make Changes. If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a repository infringe, we will skip to Step 6 and disable the entire repository expeditiously. Otherwise, because GitHub cannot disable access to specific files within a repository, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them approximately 24 hours to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes. User Notifies GitHub of Changes. If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the approximately 24-hour window. If they don't, we will disable the repository (as described in Step 6). If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and then notify the copyright owner. Copyright Owner Revises or Retracts the Notice. If the user makes changes, the copyright owner must review them and renew or revise their takedown notice if the changes are insufficient. GitHub will not take any further action unless the copyright owner contacts us to either renew the original takedown notice or submit a revised one. If the copyright owner is satisfied with the changes, they may either submit a formal retraction or else do nothing. GitHub will interpret silence longer than two weeks as an implied retraction of the takedown notice. GitHub May Disable Access to the Content. GitHub will disable a user's content if: (i) the copyright owner has alleged copyright over the user's entire repository (as noted in Step 3); (ii) the user has not made any changes after being given an opportunity to do so (as noted in Step 4); or (iii) the copyright owner has renewed their takedown notice after the user had a chance to make changes. If the copyright owner chooses instead to revise the notice, we will go back to Step 2 and repeat the process as if the revised notice were a new notice. User May Send A Counter Notice. We encourage users who have had content disabled to consult with a lawyer about their options. If a user believes that their content was disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, they may send us a counter notice. As with the original notice, we will make sure that the counter notice is sufficiently detailed (as explained in the how-to guide). If it is, we will post it to our public repository and pass the notice back to the copyright owner by sending them the link. Copyright Owner May File a Legal Action. If a copyright owner wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. In other words, you might get sued. If the copyright owner does not give GitHub notice within 10-14 days, by sending a copy of a valid legal complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, GitHub will reenable the disabled content.   B. What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?) One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to \"fork\" one another's repositories. What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories. As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project. Each of these copies is a \"fork\" of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the \"parent\" of the fork. GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. This is because forks belong to different users, may have been altered in significant ways, and may be licensed or used in a different way that is protected by the fair-use doctrine. GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks. We expect copyright owners to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks are also infringing, expressly include forks in their takedown notice.  C. What If I Inadvertently Missed the Window to Make Changes? We recognize that there are many valid reasons that you may not be able to make changes within the approximate 24-hour window we provide before your repository gets disabled. Maybe our message got flagged as spam, maybe you were on vacation, maybe you don't check that email account regularly, or maybe you were just busy. We get it. If you respond to let us know that you would have liked to make the changes, but somehow missed the first opportunity, we will re-enable the repository one additional time for approximately 24 hours to allow you to make the changes. Again, you must notify us that you have made the changes in order to keep the repository enabled after that 24-hour window, as noted above in Step A.4. Please note that we will only provide this one additional chance.  D. Transparency We believe that transparency is a virtue. The public should know what content is being removed from GitHub and why. An informed public can notice and surface potential issues that would otherwise go unnoticed in an opaque system. We post redacted copies of any legal notices we receive (including original notices, counter notices or retractions) at https://github.com/github/dmca. We will not publicly publish your personal contact information; we will remove personal information (except for usernames in URLs) before publishing notices. We will not, however, redact any other information from your notice unless you specifically ask us to. Here are some examples of a published notice and counter notice for you to see what they look like. When we remove content, we will post a link to the related notice in its place. Please also note that, although we will not publicly publish unredacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it.   E. Repeated Infringement It is the policy of GitHub, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole discretion, to disable and terminate the accounts of users who may infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of GitHub or others.  F. Submitting Notices If you are ready to submit a notice or a counter notice:  How to Submit a DMCA Notice How to Submit a DMCA Counter Notice   Learn More and Speak Up If you poke around the Internet, it is not too hard to find commentary and criticism about the copyright system in general and the DMCA in particular. While GitHub acknowledges and appreciates the important role that the DMCA has played in promoting innovation online, we believe that the copyright laws could probably use a patch or two—if not a whole new release. In software, we are constantly improving and updating our code. Think about how much technology has changed since 1998 when the DMCA was written. Doesn't it just make sense to update these laws that apply to software? We don't presume to have all the answers. But if you are curious, here are a few links to scholarly articles and blog posts we have found with opinions and proposals for reform:   Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years Under the DMCA (Electronic Frontier Foundation)  Statutory Damages in Copyright Law: A Remedy in Need of Reform (William &amp; Mary Law Review)  Is the Term of Protection of Copyright Too Long? (The 1709 Blog)  If We're Going to Change DMCA's 'Notice &amp; Takedown,' Let's Focus on How Widely It's Abused (TechDirt)  Opportunities for Copyright Reform (Cato Unbound)  Fair Use Doctrine and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act: Does Fair Use Exist on the Internet Under the DMCA? (Santa Clara Law Review)  GitHub doesn't necessarily endorse any of the viewpoints in those articles. We provide the links to encourage you to learn more, form your own opinions, and then reach out to your elected representative(s) (e.g, in the U.S. Congress or E.U. Parliament) to seek whatever changes you think should be made.",

      "body": "GitHub supports rendering geoJSON and topoJSON map files within GitHub repositories. Simply commit the file as you would normally using a .geojson or .topojson extension. Files with a .json extension are also supported, but only if type is set to FeatureCollection, GeometryCollection, or topology. Then, navigate to the path of the geoJSON file on GitHub.com. When you click the paper icon on the right, you'll also see the changes made to that file as part of a commit.   Geometry Types Maps on GitHub use Leaflet.js and support all the geometry types outlined in the geoJSON spec (Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection). TopoJSON files should be type \"Topology\" and adhere to the topoJSON spec.  Styling features You can customize the way features are displayed, such as specifying a particular color or adding a descriptive icon, by passing additional metadata within the geoJSON object's properties. The options are:   marker-size - small, medium, or large   marker-color - valid RGB hex color  marker-symbol - an icon ID from the Maki project or a single alphanumeric character (a-z or 0-9).  stroke - color of a polygon edge or line (RGB)  stroke-opacity - opacity of a polygon edge or line (0.0 - 1.0)  stroke-width - width of a polygon edge or line  fill - the color of the interior of a polygon (GRB)  fill-opacity - the opacity of the interior of a polygon (0.0-1.0)  See version 1.1.0 of the open simplestyle spec for more information.  Embedding your map elsewhere Want to make your geoJSON map available someplace other than GitHub? Simply modify this template, and place it in any HTML page that supports javascript (e.g., GitHub Pages): &lt;script src=\"https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;ref&gt;/&lt;path_to_file&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  For example, if your map's URL is github.com/benbalter/dc-wifi-social/blob/master/bars.geojson, your embed code would be: &lt;script src=\"https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/benbalter/dc-wifi-social/master/bars.geojson\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  By default, the embedded map 420px x 620px, but you can customize the output by passing height and width variables as parameters at the end, such as ?height=300&amp;width=500.  Note: ref can be a branch (like master), or the hash to an individual commit (like 2391ae).   Clustering If your map contains a large number of markers (roughly over 750), GitHub will automatically cluster nearby markers at higher zoom levels. Simply click the cluster or zoom in to see individual markers.  Something's up with the underlying map The underlying map data (street names, roads, etc.) are driven by OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. If you notice something's not quite right, since it's open source, simply sign up and submit a fix.  Troubleshooting If you're having trouble rendering geoJSON files, ensure you have a valid geoJSON file by running it through a geoJSON linter. If your points aren't appearing where you'd expect (e.g., in the middle of the ocean), it's likely that the data is in a projection which is currently unsupported. Currently, GitHub only supports the urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84 projection. Additionally, if your .geojson file is especially large (over 10 MB), it is not possible to render within the browser. If that's the case, you'll generally see a message that looks something like this:  It may still be possible to render the data by converting the .geojson file to TopoJSON, a compression format that, in some cases, can reduce filesize by up to 80%. Of course, you can always break the file into smaller chunks (such as by state or by year), and store the data as multiple files within the repository.

      "body": " From time to time, there are files you don't want Git to check in to GitHub. There are a few ways to tell Git which files to ignore.   Create a local .gitignore If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit. A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository. GitHub maintains an official list of recommended .gitignore files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages in the github/gitignore public repository. You can also use gitignore.io to create a .gitignore file for your operating system, programming language, or IDE. For more information, see the gitignore.io site.  In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository. Enter touch .gitignore to create a .gitignore file.  The Octocat has a Gist containing some good rules to add to this file. If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it, Git will not ignore the file if you add a rule later. In those cases, you must untrack the file first, by running the following command in your terminal:  git rm --cached FILENAME   Create a global .gitignore You can also create a global .gitignore file, which is a list of rules for ignoring files in every Git repository on your computer. For example, you might create the file at ~/.gitignore_global and add some rules to it.  Open Terminal. Run the following command in your terminal:  git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global    The Octocat has a Gist containing some good rules to add to this file.  Explicit repository excludes If you don't want to create a .gitignore file to share with others, you can create rules that are not committed with the repository. You can use this technique for locally-generated files that you don't expect other users to generate, such as files created by your editor. Use your favorite text editor to open the file called .git/info/exclude within the root of your Git repository. Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will only ignore files for your local repository.  In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository. Using your favorite text editor, open the file .git/info/exclude.   Further Reading  .gitignore manual Pro Git Example .gitignore files ",

      "body": "To host your images, GitHub uses the open-source project Camo. Camo generates an anonymous URL proxy for each image that starts with https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ and hides your browser details and related information from other users. Anyone who receives your anonymized image URL, directly or indirectly, may view your image. To keep sensitive images private, restrict them to a private network or a server that requires authentication instead of using Camo.  Troubleshooting issues with Camo In rare circumstances, images that are processed through Camo might not appear on GitHub. Here are some steps you can take to determine where the problem lies.     Windows users will either need to use the Git Powershell (which is installed alongside GitHub Desktop) or download curl for Windows.        An image is not showing up If an image is showing up in your browser but not on GitHub, you can try requesting the image locally.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Request the image using curl.  curl -i https://www.my-server.com/images/some-image.png -o /dev/null HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 06 Jun 2014 07:27:43 GMT Expires: Sun, 06 Jul 2014 07:27:43 GMT Content-Type: image/x-png Server: Google Frontend Content-Length: 6507   Check the value of Content-Type. In this case, it's image/x-png. Check that content type against the list of types supported by Camo.  If your content type is not supported by Camo, you can try several actions:  If you own the server that's hosting the image, modify it so that it returns a correct content type for images. If you're using an external service for hosting images, contact support for that service. Make a pull request to Camo to add your content type to the list.   An image that changed recently is not updating If you changed an image recently and it's showing up in your browser but not GitHub, you can try resetting the cache of the image.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Request the image using curl.  curl -i https://www.my-server.com/images/some-image.png -o /dev/null HTTP/1.1 200 OK Expires: Fri, 01 Jan 1984 00:00:00 GMT Content-Type: image/png Content-Length: 2339 Server: Jetty(8.y.z-SNAPSHOT)    Check the value of Cache-Control. In this example, there's no Cache-Control. In that case:  If you own the server that's hosting the image, modify it so that it returns a Cache-Control of no-cache for images.  If you're using an external service for hosting images, contact support for that service. If Cache-Control is set to no-cache, please contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support to resolve the problem.    Removing an image from Camo's cache Purging the cache forces every GitHub user to re-request the image, so you should use it very sparingly and only in the event that the above steps did not work.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Purge the image using curl -X PURGE on the Camo URL.  curl -X PURGE https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4d04abe0044d94fefcf9af2133223.... {\"status\": \"ok\", \"id\": \"216-8675309-1008701\"}     Viewing images on private networks If an image is being served from a private network or from a server that requires authentication, it can't be viewed by GitHub. In fact, it can't be viewed by any user without asking them to log into the server. To fix this, please move the image to a service that is publicly available.

      "body": "GitHub is fortunate to have many developers integrating with our platform. We think that’s awesome, and we want to make that experience even better. GitHub’s Developer Program (the “Program”) helps us to connect with you, share information with you, and support your creative efforts better than ever before. The special relationship between GitHub and the developer community that the Program creates requires a special set of terms. Welcome to the Registered Developer Agreement (“Agreement”). This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (“you”) and GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”, or “us”). Be sure to read this Agreement carefully - it governs your participation in the Program, and we’re only willing to let you participate in the Program if you accept all the terms of this Agreement. By clicking “I Agree” below, or by participating in the Program in any way – for example, by accessing information about GitHub products or features that aren’t yet available to the general public – you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement. IF YOU’RE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE \"YOU\" WILL MEAN THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DON’T HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST SELECT THE \"CANCEL\" BUTTON AND YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IF YOU’RE A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT THE PERSON CLICKING “I AGREE” HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND YOU TO THIS AGREEMENT.  GitHub.com’s Terms of Use Will Apply You need to have an account on GitHub.com in order to participate in the Program. By clicking “I Agree” at the bottom of this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the GitHub.com Terms of Service (the “TOS”). In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and theTOS, this Agreement will control; otherwise, both agreements will apply to you concurrently. Program Terms We post the Program’s benefits and guidelines (the “Program Overview”). As you might expect, the Program Overview will change from time to time. These changes will apply to you as a participant in the Program, so we encourage you to periodically review the Program Overview to keep apprised of any changes. For a variety of reasons, we might need to change, suspend, or discontinue the Program, or some of the benefits we offer. You agree that we can do those things without liability to you, except as specified in Section 8. API License So long as you remain compliant with the TOS, this Agreement, and the Program Terms, we grant You a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during the term of this Agreement to access and use our API (as defined in the TOS) solely for the purpose of developing, demonstrating, testing and supporting interoperability and integrations between your products and services and our products and services.  You promise not to do bad things with our API. Among other things, this means you won’t – and won’t allow or permit others to – modify, publish, sell, lease, license, distribute, or sublicense our API; decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from our API; reproduce, modify or create derivative works from our API; use our API to provide service bureau, application hosting, or processing services to third parties; incorporate or otherwise combine or integrate our API with any of your products or services; or use our API to engage in, support, or enable any kind of illegal activity.  We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part of it) with or without notice. It’s your sole responsibility to ensure that your use of the API is compatible with the then-current API. Other than the rights we expressly give you in this Agreement or the TOS, We don’t grant you any rights or licenses to our API, or to any other GitHub products or services. Your Products, Services, and Integrations  Your products, services, and integrations (collectively, your “Products”) are your responsibility. That means that you’re solely responsible for developing, operating, and maintaining all aspects of your Products; ensuring that all materials used with or in your Products are legal in all the jurisdictions where your Products are used, and don’t promote illegal activities; obtaining any rights or licenses necessary to use and/or distribute any third-party software that you use, include, integrate, or distribute with your Products; and providing your end user customers with the same high-quality technical support for your Products when they operate in conjunction with our API or any other of our products and services as you do when they operate on their own. Marketing and Publicity  Marketing and publicizing your integrations with GitHub is valuable to both of us. We want to be sure that happens in the right way, so we’ve included some language here to help clarify some basic “dos” and “don’ts”.  You agree that you won’t make any representations, warranties, guarantees or endorsements to anyone on behalf of GitHub (including, among other things, any GitHub products or services). Unless we specifically say it’s okay in the Program Terms, you promise not to state or imply that we have developed, endorsed, reviewed or otherwise approved of any of your Products.  If you decide to promote or publicize any of our products or services in connection with your Products, you’ll need to make sure that you abide by the terms of this Agreement, the Program Terms, the TOS, our trademark policy, and any other applicable GitHub policies. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TOS, and during the term of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the “GitHub Marks”) in accordance with our trademark policy and as specified in the Program Terms, solely for the purpose of publicizing your membership in the Program.  We want to tell the world about you, and your participation in the Program. To help us do that, you grant us a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the “Partner Marks”) in our marketing materials, solely for the purpose of promoting the Program and publicizing your participation in it.  Except as set forth in this Agreement and the TOS, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to grant to one party any right, title or interest in or to the other party’s Marks. You agree not to, whether during or after the term of this Agreement: (i) challenge or assist others in challenging the GitHub Marks, or our registration or enforcement of the GitHub Marks; (ii) attempt to adopt, use, apply for, or register any trademark, service mark, logo, URL, Internet domain name, or symbol that is confusingly similar to the GitHub Marks; or (iii) make any negative, false, or disparaging statements (whether written or oral) to any third-party about us, our products, or our services. Confidentiality; Pre-Release Materials  As a registered developer in the Program, you may get access to special information not available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.  You agree that any non-public information we give you, or that you may have access to as part of the Program, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for your authorized purposes as a participant in the Program (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should take reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third-party other than your employees and contractors, and then only to the extent that: (i) they need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; (ii) you make them aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (iii) you remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such employees and contractors; and (iv) we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure.  You understand that unauthorized disclosure or use of our Confidential Information could cause us irreparable harm, and significant injury that may be difficult for us to quantify. Accordingly, you agree that we’ll have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to make sure you comply with this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have. If you are required by law, regulation or a valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose our Confidential Information, you may do so, but only if you notify us before you do, and do your best to limit such disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information.  The obligations in this Section 6 won’t apply to information that you can prove: (i) was generally available to the public before we disclosed it to you; (ii) became generally available to the public after we disclosed it to you, through no action or inaction on your part, or on the part of your employees or contractors; (iii) you knew about before we disclosed it to you; (iv) was disclosed to you by a third-party, who didn’t have any confidentiality obligations with respect to it; (v) you independently developed without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third-party; or (vi) we gave you permission to disclose, in a writing signed by one of our authorized representatives.  If We give you any pre-release software or related documentation or materials, which may include videos or other forms of content (“Pre-release Materials”), then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TOS, we hereby grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable right and license to use the Pre-release Materials solely to support your testing and/or development of products or services that are designed to operate in combination with the systems or programs for which the Pre-release Materials are designed. If the Pre-release Materials are accompanied by a separate license agreement, you agree that the separate license agreement (in addition to any more restrictive provisions contained in this Agreement or the TOS) will apply. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Pre-release Materials to a human-perceivable form, and you promise not to modify, network, rent, lease, transmit, sell, or loan the Pre-release Materials, in whole or in part. You understand that we’re under no obligation to provide any Pre-release Materials to you, to provide you with updates, enhancements, or corrections to the Pre-release Materials, or to notify you of changes that we make to our products and services, now or in the future. Fees and Payment  There may be fees associated with participating in the Program. We’ll tell you what those fees are in the Program Terms, as we update them from time to time (the “Program Fees”). If you gave us your payment information before, you agree that we can charge the same credit card or PayPal account as part of this Agreement. Otherwise, you’ll need to give us a valid payment account, and other supporting information. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 8, any payments you make to us for the Program are non-refundable.You give us permission to automatically charge your payment account on the anniversary of your first payment date to cover all of the coming year’s Program Fees, unless you terminate this Agreement first according to Section 8. All fees are due in U.S. Dollars, and are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities (you’re responsible for all of those, except for taxes based on our income). Term and Termination  This Agreement begins on the date you click “Agree”, and continues for a period of one (1) year. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party gives written notice at least thirty (30) days before the current term expires that it wants to terminate, or one of us terminates it earlier in accordance with this Section 8.  Either you or GitHub may terminate this Agreement for any reason, without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other. If we terminate this Agreement or discontinue your access to the Program for any reason other than your breach of this Agreement, the Program Terms, or the TOS, we will, as your sole remedy and our sole obligation for such termination, refund you the pro rata portion of the Program Fees you paid us for the current term of this Agreement. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without the requirement of notice, if you breach any term of this Agreement, the Program Terms, or the TOS.  The rights and obligations in Sections 1, 2, 3 (second and third paragraphs), 4, 5 (second and last paragraphs), 6, 7, and 9 through 21 of this Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement all of the rights and licenses we granted you in this Agreement will immediately cease to exist, you will return (or, at our request, destroy) all of our Confidential Information and any copies (including electronic copies) which are in your possession or control, and you will certify in writing that you’ve complied with these requirements. Warranties and Disclaimers  You warrant to us that you: (i) have the authority to execute this Agreement and to perform its obligations; (ii) will conduct business in a manner that reflects favorably at all times on GitHub’s products and services and our good name, goodwill and reputation; (iii) will make no false or misleading statements or representations regarding GitHub or our products and services; (iv) will not take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representation, warranty, guarantee or endorsement to anyone on our behalf (including, without limitation, any of our products or services); and (v) will not state or imply that We have developed, endorsed, reviewed or otherwise approved of any of your Products.  THE PROGRAM, THE API AND ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WE GIVE YOU (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU WILL MEET YOUR OR YOUR END USERS’ REQUIREMENTS. Indemnity  We’re giving you lots of useful pre-release stuff as part of the Program, and there are ways that you could use that stuff improperly that could cause us harm. With that in mind, and since we can’t control the ways that you participate in the Program, you agree that you will indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims which may arise under or out of your participation in the Program; your use of the API, our Confidential Information, or any other GitHub products and services; your negligence or intentional misconduct; your Products, or any integrations you develop, design, promote or distribute using our API or any Confidential Information; any misrepresentations you make with respect to us, or our products or services; or your violation of any part of this Agreement. Limitation of Liability  IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRODUCTS LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

Visualizing attribute changes We provide a tooltip describing changes to attributes that, unlike words, would not otherwise be visible in the rendered document.

      "body": " Overview and Purpose Millions of developers host millions of projects on GitHub — both open and closed source — and we're honored to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day. Together, we all have an exciting opportunity and responsibility to make this a community we can be proud of. The GitHub Community Forum is intended to be a place for further collaboration, support, and brainstorming. This is a civilized place for connecting with other users, learning new skills, sharing feedback and ideas, and finding all the support you need for your GitHub projects. By participating in this Community, you are agreeing to the same Terms of Service that apply to GitHub.com, as well as this Community-specific Code of Conduct. With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in the GitHub Community Forum, what you can expect from moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent suspension from Community participation. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content within the Community that we determine to be in violation of either the GitHub Terms of Service or this Code of Conduct. GitHub users worldwide bring wildly different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and range from people who created their first \"Hello World\" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub and the GitHub Community Forum a welcoming environment for all the different voices and perspectives here, while maintaining a space where people are free to express themselves.  Pledge In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the GitHub Community Forum a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.  Standards Treat the GitHub Community Forum with respect. We are a shared resource — a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation. The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our Community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.  Best Practices for Building a Strong Community    Be respectful and considerate.   Be welcoming and open-minded. Other Community members may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new members and those just getting started.  Respect each other. Nothing sabotages healthy conversation like rudeness. Be civil and professional, and don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Don’t harass or grief anyone. Treat each other with dignity and consideration in all interactions. You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content, and knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.   Communicate with empathy. Disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Being part of a community means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. If you disagree with someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you address them. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.    Contribute in a positive and constructive way.   Improve the discussion. Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.   Be clear and stay on topic. Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person. This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in the Community Forum should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes. Additionally, the GitHub Community Forum is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.   Share mindfully. When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the Topic, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads. Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in this Community Forum, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to invite other Forum members to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists. By sharing the link to your project repo - with some information on what your project is and what kind of help or feedback you're looking for - you can invite others to collaborate with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your private information. You can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project.   Keep it tidy. Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:  Don’t start a topic in the wrong category. Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics. Don’t post no-content replies. Don't \"bump\" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share. Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.  Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Kudos button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, open a new topic.     Be trustworthy.   Always be honest. Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community Forum members. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. GitHub staff will also be active in the Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.     What is not Allowed   Threats of violence. You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it. In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety. Hate speech and discrimination. While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that talking about these or other sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe, if approached in an aggressive or insulting manner. We expect our Community members to be respectful when discussing sensitive topics. Bullying and harassment. We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory. Impersonation. You may not impersonate another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of harassment. Doxxing and invasion of privacy. Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject. Prurient/Sexually explicit content. Basically, don't post pornography. This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes. If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to post, feel free to reach out and ask beforehand. Spam. Respect the GitHub Community Forum. Don’t post advertisements, link to spammy websites, or otherwise vandalize the Community. This Community is meant for GitHub users to discuss projects, learn, and share ideas with one another - not for advertising or other spam-like content. Content that we deem spammy will be removed. Copyrighted or illegal content. Only post your own stuff. You are responsible for what you post. If you post something you didn’t create yourself, you must have the right to post it.

Enforcement  What GitHub Community Forum Members Can Do    If you see a problem, report it. Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this Community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be Community facilitators, not just janitors or police. When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just report it via \"Report Inappropriate Content\" in the Option Menu. If enough reports accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.    Our Responsibilities There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble. Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this Code of Conduct to guide our decision. Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:  Content Removal Content Blocking Community Forum Account Suspension Community Forum Account Termination  Community Forum moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Community Forum’s leadership.

Missing commit details from commits in your timeline If you click a commit link from your profile page and don't see all of the expected commits on the repository's commits page, then it's possible the commit history in Git was rewritten and the commit author date and the commit date are different.   How GitHub uses the Git author date and commit date In Git, the author date is when someone first creates a commit with git commit. The commit date is identical to the author date unless someone changes the commit date by using git commit --amend, a force push, a rebase, or other Git commands. On your profile page, the author date is used to calculate when a commit was made. Whereas, in a repository, the commit date is used to calculate when a commit was made in the repository. Most often, the author date and commit date are the same but you may notice that your commit sequence is out of order if the commit history is changed. For more information, see \"Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?\"  Viewing missing commit details from commits in your timeline You can use the git show command with the --pretty=fuller flag to check if the commit author date and commit date are different.  git show Your commit SHA number --pretty=fuller commit Your commit SHA number Author: octocat user email AuthorDate: Wed Jul 13 02:02:30 2016 +0900 Commit: Sally Johnson user email CommitDate: Wed Jul 20 06:25:08 2016 +0900  If the author and commit date are different, you can manually change the commit date in the URL to see the commit details. For example:  This URL uses the author date of 2016-07-13:  https://github.com/your-organization-or-personal-account/your-repository/commits?author=octocat&amp;since=2016-07-13T00:00:00Z&amp;until=2016-07-13T23:59:59Z  This URL uses the commit date of 2016-07-19:  https://github.com/your-organization-or-personal-account/your-repository/commits?author=octocat&amp;since=2016-07-19T00:00:00Z&amp;until=2016-07-19T23:59:59Z   When you open the URL with the modified commit date, you can see the commit details.   Expected commits missing in your timeline If you're not seeing expected commits on your timeline, it's possible the commit history in Git was rewritten and the commit author date and the commit date are different.

      "body": "When an OAuth App wants to identify you by your GitHub account, you'll see a page with the app's developer contact information and a list of the specific data that's being requested.  Tip: You must verify your email address before you can authorize an OAuth App.   OAuth App access OAuth Apps can have read or write access to your GitHub data.   Read access only allows an app to look at your data.  Write access allows an app to change your data.   Tip: We recommend that you regularly review your authorized integrations. Remove any applications and tokens that haven't been used in a while.   About OAuth scopes Scopes are named groups of permissions that an OAuth App can request to access both public and non-public data. When you want to use an OAuth App that integrates with GitHub, that app lets you know what type of access to your data will be required. If you grant access to the app, then the app will be able to perform actions on your behalf, such as reading or modifying data. For example, if you want to use an app that requests user:email scope, the app will have read-only access to your private email addresses. For more information, see \"About scopes for OAuth Apps\" in the GitHub Developer documentation.  Note: Currently, you can't scope source code access to read-only.   Types of requested data OAuth Apps can request several types of data.    Type of data Description     Commit status You can grant access for an app to report your commit status. Commit status access allows apps to determine if a build is a successful against a specific commit. Apps won't have access to your code, but they can read and write status information against a specific commit.   Deployments Deployment status access allows apps to determine if a deployment is successful against a specific commit for public and private repositories. Apps won't have access to your code.   Gists  Gist access allows apps to read or write to both your public and secret Gists.   Hooks  Webhooks access allows apps to read or write hook configurations on repositories you manage.   Notifications Notification access allows apps to read your GitHub notifications, such as comments on issues and pull requests. However, apps remain unable to access anything in your repositories.   Organizations and teams Organization and teams access allows apps to access and manage organization and team membership.   Personal user data User data includes information found in your user profile, like your name, e-mail address, and location.   Repositories Repository information includes the names of contributors, the branches you've created, and the actual files within your repository. Apps can request access for either public or private repositories on a user-wide level.   Repository delete Apps can request to delete repositories that you administer, but they won't have access to your code.     Requesting updated permissions When OAuth Apps request new access permissions, they will notify you of the differences between their current permissions and the new permissions.  OAuth Apps and organizations When you authorize an OAuth App for your personal user account, you'll also see how the authorization will affect each organization you're a member of.  For organizations with OAuth App access restrictions, you can request that organization admins approve the application for use in that organization. If the organization does not approve the application, then the application will only be able to access the organization's public resources. If you're an organization admin, you can approve the application yourself. For organizations without OAuth App access restrictions, the application will automatically be authorized for access to that organization's resources. For this reason, you should be careful about which OAuth Apps you approve for access to your personal account resources as well as any organization resources.

Troubleshooting YAML parsing errors  Tip: We strongly recommend running Jekyll locally so you can easily debug and fix build errors before pushing to GitHub. To learn more about troubleshooting options, see \"Troubleshooting GitHub Pages builds.\"  Check the YAML files in your _data folder for the following:  Check the indentation in your YAML file and remove any tab characters, as these may not conform to the suggested spacing for YAML files. Ensure that you have a space between a key's value and its preceding colon. Correct example: key: value Build fail example: key:value Check your entries for multi-line values. Including a | will create newlines for each line in the value while including &gt; will ignore newlines and leave all content on a single line.  Ensure that you're using appropriate quotations. You may need to quote URLs as well as variables or strings that begin with or contain YAML special characters following a colon.   Tip: You can use a tool like YAML Lint to help diagnose and fix YAML errors.  Once you've fixed any YAML errors, you will need to commit your changes and push to your GitHub Pages repository again to trigger another build on the server.

You can quote an entire comment by clicking , then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see \"Using keyboard shortcuts.\"   Quoting code You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.  To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.  Some basic Git commands are: ``` git status git add git commit ```   For more information, see \"Creating and highlighting code blocks.\"  Links You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link. This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).   Tip: GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see \"Autolinked references and URLS.\"   Section links You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:   Relative links You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository. A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this: [Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)  GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../. Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.  Lists You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *. - George Washington - John Adams - Thomas Jefferson   To order your list, precede each line with a number. 1. James Madison 2. James Monroe 3. John Quincy Adams    Nested Lists You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item. To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it. 1. First list item - First nested list item - Second nested list item    To create a nested list in the comment editor on GitHub, which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item. In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item 100. First list item by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (100.) before First list item. 100. First list item - First nested list item    You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven spaces (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by seven spaces. 100.

Task lists To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x]. - [x] Finish my changes - [ ] Push my commits to GitHub - [ ] Open a pull request   If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \\: - [ ] \\(Optional) Open a followup issue For more information, see \"About task lists.\"  Mentioning people and teams You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. @github/support What do you think about these updates?  When you mention a parent team, members of its child teams also receive notifications, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people. For more information, see \"About teams.\" Typing an @ symbol will bring up a list of people or teams on a project. The list filters as you type, so once you find the name of the person or team you are looking for, you can use the arrow keys to select it and press either tab or enter to complete the name. For teams, enter the @organization/team-name and all members of that team will get subscribed to the conversation. The autocomplete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread.  Referencing issues and pull requests You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing #. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result. For more information, see \"Autolinked references and URLs.\"  Content attachments Some GitHub Apps provide information in GitHub for URLs that link to their registered domains. GitHub renders the information provided by the app under the URL in the body or comment of an issue or pull request.  To see content attachments, you must have a GitHub App that uses the Content Attachments API installed on the repository. For more information, see \"Installing an app in your personal account\" and \"Installing an app in your organization.\" Content attachments will not be displayed for URLs that are part of a markdown link. For more information about building a GitHub App that uses content attachments, see \"Using Content Attachments\" in the the GitHub Developer documentation.  Using emoji You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:. @octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:  Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result. For a full list of available emoji and codes, check out emoji-cheat-sheet.com.  Paragraphs and line breaks You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.  Ignoring Markdown formatting You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \\ before the Markdown character. Let's rename \\*our-new-project\\* to \\*our-old-project\\*.

If you opt a private repository into data use, then it will perform read-only analysis of that specific private repository. You can export and review the metadata that GitHub stores about your personal account. For more information, see \"Requesting an archive of your personal account's data.\" If you opt in to data use, we will continue to treat your private data, source code, or trade secrets as confidential and private consistent with our Terms of Service.

How data improves security recommendations As an example of how your data might be used, we can detect and alert you to a security vulnerability in your public repository's dependencies. For more information, see \"About security alerts for vulnerable dependencies.\" To detect potential security vulnerabilities, GitHub scans the contents of your dependency manifest file to draw a list of your project's dependencies. GitHub also learns from changes you make to your dependency manifest. For example, if you upgrade a vulnerable dependency to a safe version after getting a security alert and others do the same, GitHub learns how to patch the vulnerability and can recommend a similar patch to affected repos.

We generally recommend installing the latest version for your operating system. Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Generate a GPG key pair. Since there are multiple versions of GPG, you many need to consult the relevant man page to find the appropriate key generation command. Your GPG key must use RSA with a key size of 4096 bits.   If you are on version 2.1.17 or greater, paste the text below to generate a GPG key pair.  gpg --full-generate-key    If you are not on version 2.1.17 or greater, the gpg --full-generate-key command doesn't work.

If your pull request compares your topic branch with a branch in the upstream repository as the base branch, then your topic branch is also called the compare branch of the pull request. For more information about pull request branches, including examples, see \"Creating a Pull Request.\"  Note: To open a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull request.

Make a fresh clone To set up a Project Pages site, you need to create a new \"orphan\" branch (a branch that has no common history with an existing branch) in your repository. The safest way to do this is to start with a fresh clone:  git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git # Clone our repository Cloning into 'repository'... remote: Counting objects: 2791, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1225/1225), done. remote: Total 2791 (delta 1722), reused 2513 (delta 1493) Receiving objects: 100% (2791/2791), 3.77 MiB | 969 KiB/s, done.

To learn more about your options, including the option to publish your Project Page from a /docs folder on your master branch, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\"    Switch directories into your new cloned repository:  cd repository    Check if your repository already has a master branch:  git branch # shows a list of branches for your repository * branch-name * branch-name    If you don't already have a master branch in your repository, create a new master branch:  git checkout --orphan master # Creates a master branch, without any parents (it's an orphan!) Switched to a new branch 'master'   Tip: If you just created the master branch, it won't appear in your list of branches when you use the git branch command until you make your first commit.     Remove all files to create an empty working directory Once you have a master branch, you'll need to remove all content from the working directory and index:  git rm -rf . # Remove all files from the old working tree rm '.gitignore'   Add content and push  In order to trigger a build when you push to your Page's repository, you must first verify your email address.  Now you have an empty working directory. You can create some content in this branch and push it to GitHub. For example:  echo \"My Page\" &gt; index.html git add index.html git commit -a -m \"First pages commit\" git push origin master  Your GitHub Pages site should now be available. You'll receive an email if your build is unsuccessful.  Load your new GitHub Pages site After your push to the master branch, your Project Pages site will be available at http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt; .

      "body": "GITHUB ENTERPRISE SERVER LICENSE AGREEMENT PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS (AS DEFINED BELOW), UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. BY CLICKING ON THE “I AGREE” OR SIMILAR BUTTON OR BY ACCESSING THE PRODUCTS, YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT. WE MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME, SUBJECT TO SECTION (CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT). This Agreement comprises the following terms and conditions and any attached exhibits or other addenda mutually agreed to by the Parties (“Exhibits”). This Agreement applies to the following GitHub products which are further defined below: (a) the Software, (b) any related Support, and (c) any related Professional Services (collectively, “Products”). If you have purchased the Products from a GitHub Partner, the following provisions of this Agreement will be superseded by the terms upon which you've agreed with the GitHub Partner: Section 7, Payment; Section 8, Delivery; Section 9, Verification; and Section 16, Termination.  Definitions. Capitalized words not listed here will be defined within the Agreement.  \"Agreement Effective Date\" is the earlier of the date that Customer either clicks \"I Agree\" to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or that it first places an Order for the Products. \"Affiliate\" means any entity that directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with a Party where “’ownership” or “control” means having more than fifty percent (50%) voting power of the controlled entity. “Confidential Information” means all non-public information disclosed by either Party to the other, in writing, orally, or by other means, designated as confidential or that a Party knows or reasonably should know, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information, is confidential to the disclosing Party. \"Documentation\" means any manuals, documentation and other supporting materials related to the Software that GitHub provides or makes available to Customer. Documentation is considered part of the Software. \"Fees\" means the fees Customer is required to pay GitHub to use the Products during the applicable License Term or Professional Services, as such fees are reflected on an Order Form or SOW. \"GitHub Partner\" means a company authorized to resell GitHub Products under the terms and conditions of GitHub's Channel Partner Agreement. \"License\" means a data file used by the Software's access control mechanism that allows Customer to install, operate, and use the Software during the License Term. “License Key” is the means by which a License is delivered via a secure, password-protected website. \"License Term\" means the period of one (1) year from the License Effective Date unless an alternate period is specified in an Order Form. GitHub will provide Customer with a renewal notice at least sixty (60) days before the expiration of License Term and will generate a new Order Form for renewal. GitHub will provide a new License Key for Customer to download that will allow continued use of the Software in accordance with the Order Form. \"Order Form\" means written or electronic documentation (including a quote) that the Parties use to order the Products. The Order Form will specify Customer’s authorized scope of use for the Products, which may include: (a) license type, (b) number and type of Seats, (c) number of production instances, (d) License Term, or (e) other restrictions or special terms (together, the “Scope of Use”). Upon execution by the Parties (or, in the case of electronic orders, confirmation and placement of the order), each Order Form will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. \"License Effective Date\" is the effective date of each Order Form as stated therein. “Parties” means references to GitHub and Customer collectively. Each may be referred to individually as a “Party”. \"Professional Services\" means training, consulting, or implementation services that GitHub provides to Customer pursuant to a mutually executed Statement of Work. Services do not include Support. “Professional Services Credits” means the payment method for purchasing Professional Services (exclusive of travel and lodging expenses) upfront that Customer may use over a period of twelve (12) months (unless otherwise stated in an Order Form) for its Professional Services needs. Any Professional Services Credits that remain unused at the end of twelve (12) months from the date of purchase (or as otherwise stated in an Order Form) are automatically cancelled and are non-refundable. \"Seats\" means the number of User accounts for the Software that Customer is authorized to create. The number of Seats is specified in an Order Form. Only one User per Seat per production License. Multiple Users are not allowed to use the same Seat. \"Software\" means GitHub’s proprietary enterprise software. Software includes any applicable Documentation, as well as any Updates to the Software that GitHub provides to Customer or that Customer can access under this Agreement. “Support” has the meaning stated in Exhibit A. \"Statement of Work\" or \"SOW\" means a mutually executed statement of work detailing the Services GitHub will perform for you, related Fees, and each Party’s related obligations. “Update” or “Release” means a Software release that GitHub makes generally available to its customers, along with any corresponding changes to Documentation. An “Update” specifically refers to an error correction or bug fix, generally indicated by a change in the digit to the right of the second decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to x.x.y). A “Release” specifically refers to an enhancement, new feature, or new functionality, generally indicated by a change in the digit to the right of the first decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to x.y.x) or to the left of the first decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to y.x.x). \"User\" means a single person or machine account that initiates the execution of the Software or interacts with or directs the Software in the performance of its functions. The number of Users should not exceed the number of Seats that Customer has licensed.  License Grant. Subject to Customer’s compliance with the Agreement, GitHub hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to install and use a single production License of the Software (unless otherwise stated in an Order Form) for its internal business purposes during the applicable License Term, in accordance with the Scope of Use and Documentation, and only for the number and type of Seats stated in an Order Form. Customer may make copies of the Software for non-production purposes only, such as testing, staging or quality assurance purposes, provided that Customer reproduces all copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on the original copy of the Software. Customer’s Affiliates, agents and contractors (together, “Authorized Third Parties”) may use the Software also, so long as its Authorized Third Parties are using it on Customer’s behalf and Customer agrees to remain fully responsible for its Authorized Third Parties’ behavior under this Agreement.  ​3. License Restrictions. As between the Parties, GitHub owns all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and any intellectual property rights associated with it and with GitHub, Inc. GitHub reserves all rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, by law, or by applicable third party license, Customer and its Affiliates must not and must not allow any third party to: (i) sublicense, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, or redistribute the Software; (ii) host the Software for the benefit of third parties; (iii) disclose or permit any third party to access the Software, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (iv) hack or modify the License Key, or avoid or change any license registration process; (v) modify or create derivative works of the Software, or merge the Software with other software; (vi) disassemble, decompile, bypass any code obfuscation, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to derive any of its source code, in whole or in part; (vii) modify, obscure, or delete any proprietary rights notices included in or on the Software or Documentation; (viii) otherwise use or copy the Software in a manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement; or (ix) use the Software beyond its applicable License Term.  Modifications to the Software. Customer may modify the Software solely for purpose of developing bug fixes, customizations and additional features to any libraries licensed under open source licenses that may be included with or linked to by the Software (“Customer Modifications”). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, GitHub has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to Customer Modifications or its combination, interaction or use with the Software. Customer must indemnify, defend and hold GitHub harmless from and against all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against GitHub by a third party relating to Customer Modifications (including but not limited to any representations or warranties Customer makes about Customer Modifications to the Software). Third Party Code. GitHub’s Software includes code and libraries licensed to GitHub by third parties, including software whose licenses require GitHub to make the source code for those components available. The source code for such components will be provided upon request. Before a new component is added to GitHub’s Software, GitHub completes a process for ensuring such component is under terms that GitHub can safely distribute and Customer can use. GitHub warrants that the Software does not and will not include any software distributed under a license that would: (a) affect Customer’s proprietary rights in its product(s) or data, (b) subject Customer to any obligation to disclose, distribute or license its own product(s) in source code form or otherwise make the product(s) available for use by others or for the purpose of creating derivative works, or (c) add or place any more onerous restrictions on Customer’s use of the Software than is included in this Agreement.  ​6. Seats. Only one person may be associated with a User account. Customer may swap out, delete, or suspend a User, and then assign a new User to the open Seat. If Customer needs more Seats, it must submit a new request through GitHub’s website or via our sales team, and pay for the additional Seats (a new Order Form will be generated). If Customer purchases additional Seats, it must pay the then-currently applicable Fees for those Seats, prorated for the balance of the applicable License Term. When the time comes to renew Customers’ Seats for another License Term, GitHub will invoice all Seats at once on an annual basis unless otherwise specified in an Order Form. Customer agrees that any Orders for additional Seats during the term of this Agreement will be governed by this Agreement. ​7. Payment. 7.1 Customer agrees to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars (or Professional Services Credits, if applicable) unless otherwise specified in an Order Form or unless purchasing through an authorized third party. If Customer is purchasing through an authorized third party, then payment terms will be agreed upon between Customer and the authorized third party. Customer must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice that GitHub sends Customer related to the applicable SOW or Order Form. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections 12.1 and 13.3. If Customer fails to pay the Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to charge Customer interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to additionally charge all expenses of recovery. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement. GitHub may also, at its sole option, elect to terminate the Order Form and Agreement. 7.2 If Customer uses its pre-paid Professional Services Credits as the means of payment for Professional Services, then upon Customer's receipt of an SOW, the applicable Professional Services Credits will be deducted from Customer's Professional Services Credits balance. Customer is responsible for ensuring that its purchase order (\"PO\") issued to GitHub for the Professional Services reflects the pricing set forth in the SOW. If there is any difference in pricing listed in the SOW and the pricing listed in the PO, the pricing in the SOW will control. The Parties agree that SOWs payable via Professional Services Credits do not have to be signed by either Party to be valid and enforceable. Subject to the SOW, all Fees paid by Customer are non-refundable and all Service Credits must be used within the time set forth in the Order Form or will automatically be cancelled and are non-refundable. Customer cannot apply Professional Services Credits to travel and lodging expenses, which must be invoiced separately. ​8. Delivery. Promptly after the applicable License Effective Date, GitHub will make the Software and the License available for Customer to download on a secure, password-protected website. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer is responsible for installation of any Software and acknowledges that GitHub has no further delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the License. As Updates become available, GitHub will make those available for download on the same website. Customer must Update the Software on a commercially reasonable basis but no less than one (1) time per year. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its usernames and passwords, including those it uses to download the Software and is responsible for any activity with respect to its usernames and passwords. ​9. Verification. At GitHub’s request, Customer agrees to promptly provide GitHub with a Software-generated report that verifies that Customer is using the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the Scope of Use. If GitHub determines that Customer has exceeded its Scope of Use, then in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity, GitHub will invoice Customer for any additional use, effective from the date Customer exceeded the Scope of Use.  Support. Subject to Customer’s compliance with this Agreement, GitHub will provide technical support for the Software as further described in the attached Exhibit A (Support Terms) during the period that Customer has paid the Fees (if applicable). Support includes access to Updates, as they are made available. Professional Services. Upon Customer’s request, GitHub will provide a Statement of Work (“SOW”) detailing the Professional Services. Each SOW is binding upon signature by the Parties and any Professional Services will be governed by the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement will control. GitHub must perform the Professional Services described in each SOW according to the timeframes set forth in that SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserve the right to determine which personnel is/are assigned to perform the Professional Services. GitHub may use third parties to perform the Professional Services provided GitHub remains responsible for all their acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services, including, among other things, software programs, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers anything to Customer during the course of performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with Customer’s use of the Software. Limited Warranties.  12.1 Limited Software Warranties. GitHub represents and warrants that: (i) the unmodified Software, at the time it is made available to Customer for download, will not contain or transmit any malware, viruses, or worms (otherwise known as computer code or other technology specifically designed to disrupt, disable, or harm Customer’s software, hardware, computer system, or network) and (ii) for ninety (90) days from the date it is made available for initial download, the unmodified Software will substantially conform to its Documentation. GitHub does not warrant that Customer’s use of the Software will be uninterrupted, or that the operation of the Software will be error-free. These warranties will not apply if Customer modifies or uses the Software in any way that is not expressly permitted by this Agreement and the Documentation.

Indemnification.  13.1 GitHub’s Indemnification Obligation. GitHub will defend and indemnify Customer against any third-party claim brought against Customer to the extent that it is based on an allegation that Customer’s authorized use or possession of the Software infringes a U.S. copyright or misappropriates a trade secret of any third party (each, a \"Claim\"), and pay damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) awarded by a court of final appeal attributable to such a Claim, provided that Customer: (i) notify GitHub in writing of any such Claim as soon as reasonably practicable; (ii) allow GitHub to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with GitHub in the defense of any such Claim and related settlement negotiations. 13.2 Exclusions. GitHub’s indemnity obligation must not extend to any Claim that is based on: (i) the modification or use of the Software other than as authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation); (ii) Customer’s failure to stop using the Software after receiving written notice to do so in order to avoid further infringement or misappropriation; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Software with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data not authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation) to the extent that without such combination the Software would have avoided a Claim (subparts (i)-(iii) may be referred to collectively as \"Indemnity Exclusions\"). 13.3 Right to Ameliorate Damages. If Customer’s use of the Software is, or in GitHub’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, subject to a Claim under Section 13.1, GitHub may, in its sole option and at no charge to Customer (and in addition to GitHub’s indemnity obligation in Section 13.1): (i) procure the right to continue using the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software so that it is non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the original Software; or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above are not commercially practicable in GitHub’s reasonable estimation, terminate this Agreement and all licenses granted hereunder (in which event, Customer must immediately stop using the Software) and GitHub must refund the unused, pre-paid Fees for the then-current License Term. 13.4 Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION 13 SETS FORTH GITHUB’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 13.5 Customer’s Indemnification Obligation.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GITHUB BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA) OR FOR THE COST OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT GITHUB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 14.2 Limitation of Total Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GITHUB’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.  Confidentiality.  15.1 Definition of Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means any business or technical information that either Party discloses to the other, in writing, orally, or by any other means, including disclosures like computer programs, code, algorithms, data, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics and other technical, business, financial, and product development plans, names and expertise of employees and consultants, and customer lists. For the purposes of this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in Section 5, the source code of the Software will be deemed to be GitHub's Confidential Information, regardless of whether it is marked as such. 15.2 Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in all events at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, \"Representatives\") (i) with a need to know such information, (ii) who are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section 15, and (iii) who are informed of the non-disclosure obligations imposed by this Section 15. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable them to contest such order or requirement.

The restrictions set forth in Section 15.2 will not apply with respect to any Confidential Information that: (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing party; or (iv) the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's Confidential Information.  Term and Termination.  16.1 Agreement Term. This Agreement starts on the Agreement Effective Date and will continue in effect until this Agreement is terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section 16. If this Agreement is terminated before the expiration or termination of a License Term, then any active Order Forms will remain in force pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 16.2 Termination for Convenience. Either Party may terminate an Order Form, with or without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice before the end of the then-current License Term stated in the Order Form. 16.3 Termination for Material Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if the other Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives notification. Either Party reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice, but without giving the other Party a cure period, if Customer breaches any of the terms of this Agreement relating to GitHub’s intellectual property (including Customer’s compliance with the license grant and any license restrictions) or either Party’s Confidential Information. 16.4 Effect of Termination; Survival. When this Agreement terminates or expires, Customer may not execute additional Order Forms; however, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect for the remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or expires, as to that Order Form: (i) the License Term for any Software will immediately end; (ii) Customer will no longer have the right to use the Software, and any Licenses granted in the Order Form will automatically cease to exist as of the date of termination or expiration; (iii) if any Fees were owed prior to termination, Customer must pay those Fees immediately; (iv) Customer must destroy all copies of the Software in its possession or control, and certify in writing to GitHub that it has done so; and (v) each Party will promptly return to the other (or, if the other party requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging to the other. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may continue to access the Software to migrate its data for ninety (90) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form; however, Customer must not use the Software on a production basis during that time. Any terms or sections which by their nature should reasonably survive will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form.  General Provisions.  ​17.1 Governing Law; Venue.

      "body": " There are two basic types of GitHub Pages sites: Project Pages sites, and User and Organization Pages sites. They are nearly identical but have some important differences.  Project Pages sites are connected to a specific project, and the site files live on a branch within the project repository. User and Organization Pages sites are not tied to a specific project, and the site files live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files.  Tip: GitHub Pages sites are always publicly accessible when published, even if their repository is private, and they shouldn't be used for sensitive transactions like sending passwords or credit card numbers. For more information, see \"What is GitHub Pages?\"   Warning: If the URL for your GitHub Pages site contains a username or organization name that begins or ends in a dash, or contains consecutive dashes, then people browsing with Linux will receive a server error when they visit the site. To fix this, change your GitHub username to remove non-alphanumeric characters. For instructions on how to do this, see \"Changing your GitHub username.\"   Project Pages sites The source files for Project Pages sites live within the same repository as their project, and they are published from one of the following locations:  The master branch The gh-pages branch A folder named \"docs\" located on the master branch  For more information, see \"Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages.\"  Building Project Pages sites Both personal and organization accounts can create Project Pages sites, and the steps for creating Project Pages sites are the same for both. Project Pages sites are available in the following locations after they're built:  A Project Pages site for a personal account is available at http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt; . A Project Pages site for an organization account is available at http(s)://&lt;orgname&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt; . If you're using a custom domain, see \"Custom domain redirects for GitHub Pages sites.\"   Using a custom domain with your Project Pages site If you are using a custom domain with a User or Organization Pages site, the custom domain replaces username.github.io in the URL for all Project Pages sites hosted under that account. Project Pages sites that use a custom domain are also available at username.github.io/projectname for personal accounts, and orgname.github.io/projectname for organizations. For more information, see \"Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages.\" Custom 404 error pages only work if a custom domain is used. Otherwise, the default User Page 404 is used. For more information, see \"Creating a custom 404 for your GitHub Pages site.\"  User and Organization Pages sites The source files for User and Organization Pages sites live on the master branch in a dedicated repository named with the GitHub account name:  To create a User Pages site, name the repository using the naming scheme &lt;username&gt;.github.io . To create an Organization Pages site, name the repository using the naming scheme &lt;orgname&gt;.github.io .   Building User and Organization Pages sites User and Organization Pages sites are available in the following locations after they're built:  A User Pages site is available at http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io . An Organization Pages site is available at http(s)://&lt;orgname&gt;.github.io . If you're using a custom domain, see \"Custom domain redirects for GitHub Pages sites.\"  User Pages sites can be built by any user account with a verified email address. They can also use deploy keys to automate the process. For more information, see \"Managing deploy keys\" in the GitHub Developer documentation. Organization Pages sites can be built by any member with push access to the repository and a verified email address. To automate builds, you can set up a machine user as a member of your organization. For more information, see \"Managing deploy keys.\" Deploy keys aren't supported for Organization Pages sites.

The template query parameter works with templates stored in an ISSUE_TEMPLATE or PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE subdirectory within the root, docs/ or .github/ directory in a repository. If a repository contains only the default pull request or issue template, any new issues or pull requests will have the default template in the body.

Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers advanced templating features, the option to quickly create a new Jekyll site with the Jekyll Theme Chooser, and Jekyll theme support. Although GitHub Pages was designed to work with any static site generator, using Jekyll offers a lot of built-in support and is the only static site generator GitHub officially documents in detail. For more information on how you can use GitHub Pages with another static site generator, see \"Using a static site generator other than Jekyll.\" The main advantages of Jekyll are:  You can use Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is simpler to read and write. You can add a Jekyll theme to your site without copying CSS files. You can quickly create a new site using the Jekyll Theme Chooser. You can use common templates, such as headers and footers, that are shared across files. You can use a simplified build process to build your site with GitHub Pages.   Jekyll's build process Jekyll's simplified build process with GitHub Pages is one of the biggest advantages of using Jekyll instead of other static site generators. GitHub Pages manages your site's build process with a single push to your site's publishing branch. This is Jekyll's build process for managing your site:  Push file changes to your pages publishing branch GitHub Pages publishes your site.   Note: The publishing branch you use depends on the type of GitHub Pages site you have.  For User or Organization pages, use the master branch. For Project pages, use the gh-pages or master branch. Alternatively, you can also publish your site from a /docs folder on the master branch. For more information, see \"Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages.\"    Jekyll site examples Jekyll is the most commonly used static site generator for GitHub Pages. We recommend using Jekyll if you want the built-in support it offers, including the GitHub Pages gem to manage dependencies, specific build failure messages, and more specific help with troubleshooting.

You can continue pushing your local repositories to the old remote tracking URL without updating it.

      "body": " Sometimes a commit will be viewable on GitHub, but will not exist in your local clone of the repository.  When you use git show to view a specific commit on the command line, you may get a fatal error. For example, you may receive a bad object error locally:  git show 1095ff3d0153115e75b7bca2c09e5136845b5592 fatal: bad object 1095ff3d0153115e75b7bca2c09e5136845b5592  However, when you view the commit on GitHub, you'll be able to see it without any problems: github.com/$account/$repository/commit/1095ff3d0153115e75b7bca2c09e5136845b5592 There are several possible explanations:  The local repository is out of date. The branch that contains the commit was deleted, so the commit is no longer referenced. Someone force pushed over the commit.   The local repository is out of date Your local repository may not have the commit yet. To get information from your remote repository to your local clone, use git fetch:  git fetch remote  This safely copies information from the remote repository to your local clone without making any changes to the files you have checked out. You can use git fetch upstream to get information from a repository you've forked, or git fetch origin to get information from a repository you've only cloned.  Tip: For more information, read about managing remotes and fetching data in the Pro Git book.   The branch that contained the commit was deleted If a collaborator on the repository has deleted the branch containing the commit or has force pushed over the branch, the missing commit may have been orphaned (i.e. it cannot be reached from any reference) and therefore will not be fetched into your local clone. Fortunately, if any collaborator has a local clone of the repository with the missing commit, they can push it back to GitHub. They need to make sure the commit is referenced by a local branch and then push it as a new branch to GitHub. Let's say that the person still has a local branch (call it B) that contains the commit. This might be tracking the branch that was force pushed or deleted and they simply haven't updated yet. To preserve the commit, they can push that local branch to a new branch (call it recover-B) on GitHub. For this example, let's assume they have a remote named upstream via which they have push access to github.com/$account/$repository. The other person runs:  git branch recover-B B # Create a new local branch referencing the commit git push upstream B:recover-B # Push local B to new upstream branch, creating new reference to commit  Now, you can run:  git fetch upstream recover-B # Fetch commit into your local repository.   Avoid force pushes Avoid force pushing to a repository unless absolutely necessary. This is especially true if more than one person can push to the repository.

      "url": "/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users",
      "body": " This Amendment to GitHub's Terms of Service applies only to users that are using GitHub on behalf of the United States federal government. If you are not using GitHub on behalf of the U.S. federal government, the standard GitHub Terms of Service apply to you.  This Amendment is an agreement between GitHub, Inc. (\"GitHub\" or \"Company\") and U.S. federal government users of the GitHub.com web site (the “Service”) and applies solely to any U.S. federal government agency and its users who use or access the Service on behalf of the U.S. federal government (the \"Government\"). You, as a United States government entity, are required, when entering into agreements with other parties, to follow applicable federal laws and regulations, including those related to ethics; privacy and security; accessibility; records retention; limitations on indemnification; fiscal law constraints; advertising and endorsements; freedom of information; and governing law and dispute resolution forum. GitHub and You (together, the \"Parties\") agree that modifications to the GitHub Terms of Service (the \"ToS\") are appropriate to accommodate Your legal status, Your public (in contrast to private) mission, and other special circumstances. Accordingly, the ToS are hereby modified by this Amendment as they pertain to the Government's use of the Company web site and services:  A. Public purpose  Government entity - \"You\" within the ToS shall mean the Government itself and shall not bind, in their individual capacity, the individual(s) who utilize the Company site or services on the Government's behalf. Company will look solely to the Government to enforce any violation or breach of the ToS by such individuals, subject to federal law. Advertisements - Company hereby agrees not to serve or display any third-party commercial advertisements or solicitations on any pages within the Company site displaying content created by or under the control of the Government. This exclusion shall not extend to house ads, which Company may serve on such pages in a non-intrusive manner. The foregoing obligations are contingent upon the email address designated on Your account details page ending in .gov, .mil, or .fed.us.   B. Your content on GitHub  Access and use - Company acknowledges that the Government's use of the Service may energize significant citizen engagement. Language in the ToS allowing Company to terminate service, refuse or remove any Content, or close the Government's account, at any time, for any reason, is modified to reflect the Parties' agreement that Company may unilaterally modify or discontinue service, temporarily or permanently, refuse or remove any Content, and/or terminate the Government's account only for breach of the Government’s obligations under the ToS or its material failure to comply with the instructions and guidelines posted on the Service, or if Company ceases to operate the Service generally. Company will provide the Government with a reasonable opportunity to cure any breach or failure on the Government's part. No endorsement - Company agrees that Your seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that You have a presence on the Company site and use its services, shall not be used by Company in such a manner as to state or imply that Company's products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by You or by any other element of the federal government, or are considered by these entities to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Government, or for links to or promotion of such pages, Company agrees not to display any government seals or logos on the Company's homepage or elsewhere on the Company Site, unless permission to do so has been granted by the Government or by other relevant federal government authority. Company may list the Government's name in a publicly available customer list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party name. Provision of data - In case of termination of service, within 30 days of such termination, upon request, Company will provide you with all user-generated content that is publicly visible through the Sites You created at Company. Data will be provided in a commonly used file or database format as Company deems appropriate. Company will not provide data if doing so would violate its privacy policy, available at https://help.github.com/privacy/.   C. Unpaid and paid plans  No cost agreement - Nothing in this Amendment or ToS obligates You to expend appropriations or incur financial obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that none of the obligations arising from this Amendment or ToS are contingent upon the payment of fees by one party to the other. At the Company’s discretion, GitHub may offer a free account under a free usage plan, such as a Free for Open Source Plan, and in that case this Amendment will apply to the Government’s usage under the free account/plan. This Amendment also applies when the Government uses one of GitHub’s paid usage plans. Government responsibilities under paid usage plans - You acknowledge that while Company will provide You with service under a free plan, Company reserves the right to begin charging for that service at some point in the future. Company will provide You with at least 30 days advance notice of a change involving the charging of fees for a free service. You also understand that Company offers paid plans for a fee. The Parties understand that fee-based services are categorically different than free products, and are subject to federal procurement rules and processes. Before the Government decides to enter into a business or enterprise subscription, or any other fee-based service that this Company or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, You agree: to determine the Government has a need for those additional services for a fee; to consider the subscription's value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere; to determine that Government funds are available for payment; to properly use the Government Purchase Card if that Card is used as the payment method; to review any then-applicable ToS for conformance to federal procurement law; and in all other respects to follow applicable federal acquisition laws, regulations and agency guidelines (including those related to payments) when initiating that separate action. No business relationship created - The Parties are independent entities and nothing in this Amendment or ToS creates an agency, partnership, joint venture, or employer/employee relationship.   D. Federal Regulations  Security - Company will, in good faith, exercise due diligence using generally accepted commercial business practices for IT security, to ensure that systems are operated and maintained in a secure manner, and that management, operational and technical controls will be employed to ensure security of systems and data. Recognizing the changing nature of the Web, Company will continuously work with users to ensure that its products and services are operated and maintained in a secure manner. Company agrees to discuss implementing additional security controls as deemed necessary by the Government to conform to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3541 et seq. Federal Records - Government acknowledges that use of Company's site and services may require management of Federal records. Government and user-generated content may meet the definition of Federal records as determined by the agency. If the Company holds Federal records, the Government and the Company must manage Federal records in accordance with all applicable records management laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chs. 21, 29, 31, 33), and regulations of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B). Managing the records includes, but is not limited to, secure storage, retrievability, and proper disposition of all Federal records including transfer of permanently valuable records to NARA in a format and manner acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer. The Government is responsible for ensuring that the Company is compliant with applicable records management laws and regulations through the life and termination of the Agreement.   E. General Conditions  Indemnification - Any provisions in the ToS related to indemnification, damages, attorney’s fees, and settlement are hereby waived. Liability of the Government for any breach of the ToS or this Agreement, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the ToS or this Agreement, shall be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or other governing authority. Liability of Company for any breach of the ToS or this Agreement, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the ToS or this Agreement, shall be determined by applicable federal or state law. Limitation of liability - The Parties agree that nothing in the Limitation of Liability clause or elsewhere in the ToS in any way grants Company a waiver from, release of, or limitation of liability pertaining to, any past, current or future violation of federal law. Governing law and Forum - The dispute resolution provision in the ToS is hereby deleted. The ToS and this Amendment shall be governed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with applicable federal laws of the United States of America and exclusive jurisdiction shall be in the appropriate U.S. federal courts. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply in the absence of federal law. Assignment - Neither party may assign its obligations under this Amendment or ToS to any third-party without prior written consent of the other; however, GitHub may, without the Government's consent, assign its obligations to an Government using the service under a free usage plan under this Amendment or ToS to an affiliate or to a successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of GitHub's assets.   F. Changes to this agreement  Precedence; Further Amendment; Termination - This Amendment constitutes an amendment to the ToS; language in the ToS indicating it may not be modified or that it alone is the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the ToS, or between this Amendment and other rules or policies on the Company site or services, this Amendment shall prevail. This Amendment may be further amended only upon written agreement executed by both Parties. The Government may close its account and terminate this agreement at any time. Company may close Government's account and terminate this agreement on 30 days written notice, but the Government shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid. Posting and availability of this Amendment - The parties agree this Amendment contains no confidential or proprietary information, and either party may release it to the public at large. ",

For more information, see \"Jekyll on Windows\" in the official Jekyll documentation.   Requirements We recommend using Bundler to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler, you must install Ruby.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Check whether you have Ruby 2.1.0 or higher installed:  ruby --version ruby 2.X.X   If you don't have Ruby installed, install Ruby 2.1.0 or higher.  Install Bundler:  gem install bundler # Installs the Bundler gem   If you already have a local repository for your Jekyll site, skip to Step 2.   Step 1: Create a local repository for your Jekyll site  If you haven't already downloaded Git, install it. For more information, see \"Set up Git.\" Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  On your local computer, initialize a new Git repository for your Jekyll site:  git init JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/octocat/my-site/.git/ # Creates a new file directory on your local computer, initialized as a Git repository    Change directories to the new repository you created:  cd JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME # Changes the working directory    If your new local repository is for a Project pages site, create a new gh-pages branch:  Note: You can skip this step if you would rather use the master branch for your Project Page. If you haven't checked out any branches, once you make a commit in your local repository, your change will appear on the master branch by default.   git checkout -b gh-pages Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages' # Creates a new branch called 'gh-pages', and checks it out   Tip: To learn more about creating a User, Organization or Project Page and which branch to use, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\" To learn more about how to build your site's source files from a /docs folder on the master branch, see \"Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages.\"     Step 2: Install Jekyll using Bundler To track your site's dependencies, Ruby will use the contents of your Gemfile to build your Jekyll site.   Check to see if you have a Gemfile in your local Jekyll site repository:  ls Gemfile  If you have a Gemfile, skip to step 4. If you don't have a Gemfile, skip to step 2.   If you don't have a Gemfile, open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and add these lines to a new file:  source 'https://rubygems.org' gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins   Name the file Gemfile and save it to the root directory of your local Jekyll site repository. Skip to step 5 to install Jekyll.  If you already have a Gemfile, open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and add these lines to your Gemfile:  source 'https://rubygems.org' gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins    Install Jekyll and other dependencies from the GitHub Pages gem:  bundle install Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/............ Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/... Fetching dependency metadata from https://rubygems.org/.. Resolving dependencies...    Tip: If you see a Ruby error when you try to install Jekyll using Bundler, you may need to use a package manager, such as RVM or Homebrew, to manage your Ruby installation. For more information, see Jekyll's troubleshooting page.      Step 3 (optional): Generate Jekyll site files To build your Jekyll site locally, preview your site changes, and troubleshoot build errors, you must have Jekyll site files on your local computer. You may already have Jekyll site files on your local computer if you cloned a Jekyll site repository. If you don't have a Jekyll site downloaded, you can generate Jekyll site files for a basic Jekyll template site in your local repository. If you want to use an existing Jekyll site repository on GitHub as the starting template for your Jekyll site, fork and clone the Jekyll site repository on GitHub to your local computer. For more information, see \"Fork a repo.\"  Note: As of Jekyll 3.2, the default Jekyll site contains a Gemfile that locks Jekyll to the Gem version you build it with. To instead lock it to the version used by GitHub Pages, you'll uncomment the gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins line in the steps below.    If you don't already have a Jekyll site on your local computer, create a Jekyll template site in a new directory:  bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new NEW-JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME New jekyll site installed in /Users/octocat/NEW-JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME.    Navigate into your new site directory:  cd NEW-JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME    Edit your Gemfile and remove the following line:  \"jekyll\", \"3.3.0\"    In the Gemfile, delete the # at the beginning of this line:  gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins    Initialize your site directory as a Git repository.  git init Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/octocat/name-of-your-directory    Connect your remote repository on GitHub to your local repository for your GitHub Pages site.  git remote add origin https://github.com/username-or-organization-name/your-remote-repository-name   To edit the Jekyll template site, open your new Jekyll site files in a text editor. Make your changes and save them in the text editor. You can preview these changes locally on your computer without committing your changes using Git by running a Jekyll command to build your site.  Add or stage your changes.  git add .    Commit your changes with a comment.  git commit -m \"updated site\"    To publish your changes on your GitHub Pages site, push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub.  git push -u origin master    For more information on using this Git workflow, see \"Good Resources for Learning Git and GitHub\" or see this Git cheat sheet.  Step 4: Build your local Jekyll site  Navigate into the root directory of your local Jekyll site repository.  Run your Jekyll site locally:  bundle exec jekyll serve Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml  Source: /Users/octocat/my-site  Destination: /Users/octocat/my-site/_site Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental  Generating...  done in 0.309 seconds. Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/octocat/my-site' Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml  Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.   Preview your local Jekyll site in your web browser at http://localhost:4000.   Keeping your site up to date with the GitHub Pages gem Jekyll is an active open source project and is updated frequently. As the GitHub Pages server is updated, the software on your computer may become out of date, resulting in your site appearing different locally from how it looks when published on GitHub.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Run this update command:  If you followed our setup recommendations and installed Bundler, run bundle update github-pages or simply bundle update and all your gems will update to the latest versions. If you don't have Bundler installed, run gem update github-pages      Next steps: Configuring Jekyll To configure your pages site further, see \"Configuring Jekyll.\" To set up a project pages site, see Jekyll's official documentation on project pages URLs.

Tips:  You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the osxkeychain credential helper. If you installed Git using Homebrew, the osxkeychain helper will already be installed. If you're running Mac OS X 10.7 and above and you installed Git through Apple's Xcode Command Line Tools, then osxkeychain helper is automatically included in your Git installation.   Install Git and the osxkeychain helper and tell Git to use it.

After you've done this, the username and password are stored in your keychain and you won't be required to type them in to Git again.    Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.  You can also install a native Git shell, such as Git for Windows. With Git for Windows, running the following in the command line will store your credentials:  git config --global credential.helper wincred     Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.

You can also install GitHub Apps from a third-party in a specific repository where you have admin permissions or which is owned by your organization.  Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps Integrations can be GitHub Apps, OAuth Apps, or anything that utilizes GitHub APIs or webhooks. GitHub Apps offer granular permissions and request access to only what the app needs. GitHub Apps also offer specific user-level permissions that each user must authorize individually when an app is installed or when the integrator changes the permissions requested by the app. For more information, see:  \"Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps\" in the GitHub Developer documentation \"About apps\" in the GitHub Developer documentation \"User-level permissions\" in the GitHub Developer documentation \"Authorizing OAuth Apps\" \"Reviewing your authorized integrations\"  You can install a preconfigured GitHub App, if the integrators or app creators have created their app with the GitHub App manifest flow. For information about how to run your GitHub App with automated configuration, contact the integrator or app creator. You can create a GitHub App with simplified configuration if you build your app with Probot. For more information, see the Probot docs site.  Discovering integrations in GitHub Marketplace and Works with GitHub You can find an integration to install or publish your own integration in GitHub Marketplace and Works with GitHub. GitHub Marketplace contains GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps. For more information on finding an integration or creating your own integration, see \"About GitHub Marketplace.\" You can find other types of approved integrations on Works with GitHub.  Note: You can also submit an integration for inclusion on Works with GitHub. For more information, see \"Adding integrations to Works with GitHub\" in the GitHub Developer documentation.   Integrations purchased directly from integrators You can also purchase some integrations directly from integrators. As an organization member, if you find a GitHub App that you'd like to use, you can request that an organization approve and install the app for the organization. If you have admin permissions for all organization-owned repositories the app is installed on, you can install GitHub Apps with repository-level permissions without having to ask an organization owner to approve the app. When an integrator changes an app's permissions, if the permissions are for a repository only, organization owners and people with admin permissions to a repository with that app installed can review and accept the new permissions.",

      "body": " In this article:   Subdomains  www subdomains Custom subdomains Setting up subdomains    Apex domains  Setting up apex domains   Further reading  We recommend choosing a supported custom domain because unsupported custom domains are not guaranteed to work and may require a domain forwarding service or extra setup with your DNS provider. These supported custom domains are optimized for GitHub Pages. The most recommended custom domain types are bold.    Supported custom domain type Example domain     www subdomain www.example.com   one apex domain &amp; one www subdomain  example.com &amp; www.example.com    apex domain example.com   custom subdomain blog.example.com     Tip: We recommend using a www subdomain as your custom domain. If you choose to use an apex domain as your custom domain then we recommend setting up a www subdomain as well. To learn why, see \"www subdomains\"   Subdomains The term subdomain has two common meanings:   A customizable and optional part of a domain name located before the root or apex domain that looks like a domain prefix.  A type of domain that contains a subdomain part.  To avoid confusion, custom domains with different subdomain parts are assigned different labels. A custom domain without a subdomain part, such as example.com, is called an apex domain.    Subdomain Subdomain part Subdomain type     www.example.com www  www subdomain   blog.example.com blog custom subdomain     www subdomains A www subdomain is the most commonly used type of subdomain, in which the www stands for World Wide Web. For example, www.example.com is a www subdomain because it contains the subdomain part www. We strongly recommend that you use a www subdomain for these reasons:  It gives your GitHub Pages site the benefit of our Content Delivery Network. It is more stable because it is not affected by changes to the IP addresses of GitHub's servers. Pages will load significantly faster because Denial of Service attack protection can be implemented more efficiently.   Custom subdomains A custom subdomain is a type of subdomain that doesn't use the standard www subdomain part. It is commonly used to manage different host locations or computer servers. For example, blog in blog.example.io may be hosted on a different computer server than www.example.io or photos.example.io. GitHub Pages supports one custom subdomain per pages site.  Setting up subdomains A subdomain is configured with a CNAME record through your DNS provider. To learn more about setting up a subdomain, see one of these articles:  Setting up a www subdomain Setting up an apex domain and www subdomain Setting up a custom subdomain   Apex domains An apex domain is a root domain that does not contain a subdomain part. Apex domains are also known as base, bare, naked, root apex, or zone apex domains. In DNS provider settings apex domains are sometimes symbolized by an @ symbol. For example:   example.com is an apex domain because it doesn't have any subdomain parts. Whereas www.example.com is not an apex domain because it contains the subdomain part www.   Setting up apex domains An apex domain is usually configured with an A, ALIAS, or ANAME record through your DNS provider. To learn more about setting up an apex domain, see one of these articles:  \"Setting up an apex domain\" \"Setting up an apex domain and www subdomain\"   Tip: If you are using an apex domain as your custom domain, we recommend setting up a www subdomain as well.

When adding your SSH key to the agent, use the default macOS ssh-add command, and not an application installed by macports, homebrew, or some other external source.    Start the ssh-agent in the background.  eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\" Agent pid 59566    If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.  ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa   Note: The -K option is Apple's standard version of ssh-add, which stores the passphrase in your keychain for you when you add an ssh key to the ssh-agent. If you don't have Apple's standard version installed, you may receive an error. For more information on resolving this error, see \"Error: ssh-add: illegal option -- K.\"   Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.    If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can use it to clone repositories and not deal with SSH keys. It also comes with the Git Bash tool, which is the preferred way of running git commands on Windows.   Ensure the ssh-agent is running:  If you are using the Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, the ssh-agent should be running. If you are using another terminal prompt, such as Git for Windows, you can use the \"Auto-launching the ssh-agent\" instructions in \"Working with SSH key passphrases\", or start it manually:  # start the ssh-agent in the background eval $(ssh-agent -s) Agent pid 59566      Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa   Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.

Commits Commits will appear on your contributions graph if they meet all of the following conditions:  The email address used for the commits is associated with your GitHub account. The commits were made in a standalone repository, not a fork. The commits were made:  In the repository's default branch (usually master) In the gh-pages branch (for repositories with Project Pages sites)    In addition, at least one of the following must be true:  You are a collaborator on the repository or are a member of the organization that owns the repository. You have forked the repository. You have opened a pull request or issue in the repository. You have starred the repository.   Common reasons that contributions are not counted  Notes:  To appear on your profile contributions graph, co-authored commits must meet the same criteria as commits with one author. When a pull request is merged and commits are squashed, only the user that merged the pull request and the user that opened the pull request receive contribution credit. No other contributors to the pull request will receive contribution credit. When rebasing commits, the original authors of the commit and the person who rebased the commits, whether on the command line or on GitHub, receive contribution credit.    Commit was made less than 24 hours ago After making a commit that meets the requirements to count as a contribution, you may need to wait for up to 24 hours to see the contribution appear on your contributions graph.  You haven't added your local Git commit email to your profile Commits must be made with an email address that has been added to your GitHub profile in order to appear on your contributions graph. You can check the email address used for a commit by adding .patch to the end of a commit URL, e.g. https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io/commit/67c0afc1da354d8571f51b6f0af8f2794117fd10.patch: From 67c0afc1da354d8571f51b6f0af8f2794117fd10 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: The Octocat &lt;octocat@nowhere.com&gt; Date: Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:36:39 +0530 Subject: [PATCH] updated index for better welcome message  The email address in the From: field is the address that was set in the local git config settings. In this example, the email address used for the commit is octocat@nowhere.com. If the email address used for the commit hasn't been added to your GitHub profile, you must add the email address to your GitHub account. Your contributions graph will be rebuilt automatically when you add the new address.  Generic email addresses--such as jane@computer.local--cannot be added to GitHub accounts. If you use such an email for your commits, the commits will not be linked to your GitHub profile and will not show up in your contributions graph.   Commit was not made in the default or gh-pages branch Commits are only counted if they are made in the default branch (usually master) or the gh-pages branch (for repositories with Project Pages sites). If your commits are in a non-default or non-gh-pages branch and you'd like them to count toward your contributions, you will need to do one of the following:   Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the default branch or the gh-pages branch.  Change the default branch of the repository.   Changing the default branch of the repository will change it for all repository collaborators. Only do this if you want the new branch to become the base against which all future pull requests and commits will be made.   Commit co-author doesn't have access to the repository If a commit was made in a repository that the co-author doesn't have access to, then that commit will not count towards the co-author's contributions.  Commit was made in a fork Commits made in a fork will not count toward your contributions. To make them count, you must do one of the following:   Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the parent repository. To detach the fork and turn it into a standalone repository on GitHub, contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support. If the fork has forks of its own, let support know if the forks should move with your repository into a new network or remain in the current network. For more information, see \"About forks.\"   Commit was made in a pull request that was merged and squashed Commits made in a pull request that was merged and squashed will not count toward your contributions.

Note: This article applies to installing and purchasing apps from GitHub Marketplace only. For more information on apps purchased from integrators, see \"About integrations.\"   Tip: If an app requires organization-level access, then only an organization owner can purchase, install, or cancel the app, and manage app billing for the organization. If the app doesn't require organization-level access, then a repository administrator can install and uninstall the app.   Payment methods and billing cycles for GitHub Marketplace purchases You will have the same payment method for all paid plans and subscriptions across GitHub. If your personal account or organization doesn't have a payment method on file, when you choose a paid plan for an app:  Your billing date is today. You must add a payment method to your personal account or the organization in which you want to install the app. Your payment method is charged the full amount of your subscription. Your receipt is sent to the primary or billing email address on file for your personal account or organization.  If your personal account or organization has an existing payment method, when you choose a paid plan for an app:  The payment method on file is immediately charged a prorated amount based on the time remaining until your next billing date. The monthly or yearly billing date for your app subscription is the same as the account or organization's regular billing date. On your next billing date, your receipt lists charges for your paid GitHub plan and your app subscription.  When you choose a paid plan with a free trial:  You must have an existing payment method or add a new payment method for your personal account or the organization in which you want to install the app. If you don't have any other paid plans or subscriptions, you are charged the full amount of your subscription at the end of the 14-day free trial. If you have other paid plans or subscriptions, once your 14-day free trial ends, the payment method on file is immediately charged a prorated amount based on the time remaining until your next billing date. If you have other paid plans or subscriptions, on your next billing date, your receipt lists charges for your paid GitHub plan and your app subscription.   Unit plan limits If you choose a unit plan (for example, a plan that charges per user), and you exceed the units that you're paying for, the integrator may disable your access until you upgrade the app. For more information, see \"Upgrading the billing plan for a GitHub Marketplace app.\"  Downgrading a GitHub Marketplace app If you downgrade your app subscription to a less expensive plan or if you cancel a paid app subscription, your changes will take effect at the end your current billing cycle. Your subscription will be moved to your new plan on your next billing date. If you cancel an app on a free plan, your subscription will immediately end and you'll lose access to the app. Canceling an app or downgrading an app to free does not affect your other paid subcriptions on GitHub. If you want to cease all of your paid subscriptions on GitHub, you must downgrade each paid subscription separately. If you cancel a free trial on a paid plan, your subscription is immediately canceled and you will lose access to the app. For more information, see \"Canceling a GitHub Marketplace app.\"  Further reading  \"About GitHub Marketplace\" \"Purchasing and installing apps in GitHub Marketplace\" \"GitHub Marketplace support\" ",

Check your Git version There's no minimum Git version necessary to interact with GitHub, but we've found version 1.7.10 to be a comfortable stable version that's available on many platforms. You can always download the latest version on the Git website.  Ensure the remote is correct The repository you're trying to fetch must exist on GitHub, and the URL is case-sensitive. You can find the URL of the local repository by opening the command line and typing git remote -v:  git remote -v # View existing remotes origin https://github.com/github/reactivecocoa.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/github/reactivecocoa.git (push) git remote set-url origin https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa.git # Change the 'origin' remote's URL git remote -v # Verify new remote URL origin https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa.git (push)  Alternatively, you can change the URL through our GitHub Desktop application.  Provide an access token If you have enabled two-factor authentication, or if you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you must provide a personal access token instead of entering your password for HTTPS Git.  Check your permissions When prompted for a username and password, make sure you use an account that has access to the repository.  Tip: If you don't want to enter your username and password every time you interact with the remote repository, you can turn on password caching.   Use SSH instead If you've previously set up SSH keys, you can use the SSH clone URL instead of HTTPS. For more information, see \"Which remote URL should I use?\"",

      "body": "A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you communicate expectations for and manage contributions to your project. A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:  What the project does Why the project is useful How users can get started with the project Where users can get help with your project Who maintains and contributes to the project  If you put your README file in your repository's root, docs, or hidden .github directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.   Section links in README files and blob pages Many projects use a table of contents at the start of a README to direct users to different sections of the file. You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:   Relative links and image paths in README files You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository. A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this: [Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)  GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../. Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.

      "body": " If a commit message contains unclear, incorrect, or sensitive information, you can amend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to GitHub. You can also amend a commit to add a co-author.   Rewriting the most recent commit message You can change the most recent commit message using the git commit --amend command.  In Git, the text of the commit message is part of the commit. Changing the commit message will change the commit ID--i.e., the SHA1 checksum that names the commit. Effectively, you are creating a new commit that replaces the old one.   Commit has not been pushed online If the commit only exists in your local repository and has not been pushed to GitHub, you can amend the commit message with the git commit --amend command.  On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend. Type git commit --amend and press Enter. In your text editor, edit the commit message and save the commit. You can also add a co-author by adding a trailer to the commit. For more information, see \"Creating a commit with multiple authors.\"  The new commit and message will appear on GitHub the next time you push.  You can change the default text editor for Git by changing the core.editor setting. For more information, see \"Basic Client Configuration\" in the Git manual.   Amending older or multiple commit messages If you have already pushed the commit to GitHub, you will have to force push a commit with an amended message.  We strongly discourage force pushing, since this changes the history of your repository. If you force push, people who have already cloned your repository will have to manually fix their local history. For more information, see \"Recovering from upstream rebase\" in the Git manual.  Amending the message of the most recently pushed commit  Follow the steps above to amend the commit message. Use the push --force command to force push over the old commit.  git push --force example-branch    Amending the message of older or multiple commit messages If you need to amend the message for multiple commits or an older commit, you can use interactive rebase, then force push to change the commit history.  On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend. Use the git rebase -i HEAD~n command to display a list of the last n commits in your default text editor.  git rebase -i HEAD~3 # Displays a list of the last 3 commits on the current branch    The list will look similar to the following:  pick e499d89 Delete CNAME pick 0c39034 Better README pick f7fde4a Change the commit message but push the same commit. # Rebase 9fdb3bd..f7fde4a onto 9fdb3bd # # Commands: # p, pick = use commit # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell # # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom. # # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST. # # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted. # # Note that empty commits are commented out    Replace pick with reword before each commit message you want to change.  pick e499d89 Delete CNAME reword 0c39034 Better README reword f7fde4a Change the commit message but push the same commit.   Save and close the commit list file. In each resulting commit file, type the new commit message, save the file, and close it. Force-push the amended commits.  git push --force    For more information on interactive rebase, see \"Interactive mode\" in the Git manual.  As before, amending the commit message will result in a new commit with a new ID. However, in this case, every commit that follows the amended commit will also get a new ID because each commit also contains the id of its parent.   If you have included sensitive information in a commit message, force pushing a commit with an amended commit may not remove the original commit from GitHub. The old commit will not be a part of a subsequent clone; however, it may still be cached on GitHub and accessible via the commit ID. You must contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support with the old commit ID to have it purged from the remote repository.   Further reading  \"Signing commits\" ",

To work around Git's architecture, Git LFS creates a pointer file which acts as a reference to the actual file (which is stored somewhere else). GitHub manages this pointer file in your repository. When you clone the repository down, GitHub uses the pointer file as a map to go and find the large file for you. As an analogy, say you walk into a restaurant wearing an enormous coat. You hand your coat over to the attendant, and it's exchanged for a ticket that identifies where the coat is stored. After you finish your meal, you hand your ticket to the attendant, who retrieves your coat from storage and returns it to you. Git LFS works the same way. You can also use Git LFS with GitHub Desktop. For more information about cloning Git LFS repositories in GitHub Desktop, see \"Cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop.\"  Pointer file format Git LFS's pointer file looks like this: version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1 oid sha256:4cac19622fc3ada9c0fdeadb33f88f367b541f38b89102a3f1261ac81fd5bcb5 size 84977953  It tracks the version of Git LFS you're using, followed by a unique identifier for the file (oid).

You won't trigger a build if you use a deploy key to push to an organization's Pages repository. Instead, you can set up a machine user as a member of your organization.  Unsupported plugins The GitHub Pages server will not build with unsupported plugins. The only way to incorporate unsupported plugins in your site is to generate your site locally and then push your site's static files to your GitHub Pages site. For a list of supported plugins and instructions on how to include them in your GitHub Pages site, see \"Adding Jekyll plugins to a GitHub Pages site.\"  Size limits Repositories on GitHub have a soft limit of 1 GB per repository. Similarly, GitHub Pages sites also have a 1 GB soft limit. If your Pages site exceeds that limit, you may find that your site won't build. You may also receive a polite email from us requesting that you reduce the size of your site.  Source setting Our build server overrides the source setting when it builds Pages sites. If you change this setting in your _config.yml file, your GitHub Pages site may not build correctly.  Working with continuous integration services Some CI services, such as Travis CI, won't build your gh-pages branch unless you explicitly whitelist it. If you want your GitHub Pages site to integrate with a CI service, you'll need to specify the gh-pages branch in your CI's configuration file.

To sign all commits by default in any local repository on your computer, run git config --global commit.gpgsign true. To store your GPG key passphrase so you don't have to enter it every time you sign a commit, we recommend using the following tools:  For Mac users, the GPG Suite allows you to store your GPG key passphrase in the Mac OS Keychain. For Windows users, the Gpg4win integrates with other Windows tools.  You can also manually configure gpg-agent to save your GPG key passphrase, but this doesn't integrate with Mac OS Keychain like ssh-agent and requires more setup.  If you have multiple keys or are attempting to sign commits or tags with a key that doesn't match your committer identity, you should tell Git about your signing key.   When committing changes in your local branch, add the -S flag to the git commit command:  git commit -S -m your commit message # Creates a signed commit   If you're using GPG, after you create your commit, provide the passphrase you set up when you generated your GPG key.

      "body": " Directory structure Each reference, or labeled snapshot of a commit, in a project is organized within specific subdirectories, such as trunk, branches, and tags. For example, an SVN project with two features under development might look like this:  sample_project/trunk/README.md sample_project/trunk/lib/widget.rb sample_project/branches/new_feature/README.md sample_project/branches/new_feature/lib/widget.rb sample_project/branches/another_new_feature/README.md sample_project/branches/another_new_feature/lib/widget.rb  An SVN workflow looks like this:  The trunk directory represents the latest stable release of a project. Active feature work is developed within subdirectories under branches. When a feature is finished, the feature directory is merged into trunk and removed.  Git projects are also stored within a single directory. However, Git obscures the details of its references by storing them in a special .git directory. For example, a Git project with two features under development might look like this:  sample_project/.git sample_project/README.md sample_project/lib/widget.rb  A Git workflow looks like this:  A Git repository stores the full history of all of its branches and tags within the .git directory. The latest stable release is contained within the master branch. Active feature work is developed in separate branches. When a feature is finished, the feature branch is merged into master and deleted.  Unlike SVN, with Git the directory structure remains the same, but the contents of the files change based on your branch.  Including subprojects A subproject is a project that's developed and managed somewhere outside of your main project. You typically import a subproject to add some functionality to your project without needing to maintain the code yourself. Whenever the subproject is updated, you can synchronize it with your project to ensure that everything is up-to-date. In SVN, a subproject is called an SVN external. In Git, it's called a Git submodule. Although conceptually similar, Git submodules are not kept up-to-date automatically; you must explicitly ask for a new version to be brought into your project. Here are some external resources that explain the differences in more detail:  Understanding Git Submodules Git Tools Submodules   Preserving history SVN is configured to assume that the history of a project never changes. Git allows you to modify previous commits and changes using tools like git rebase.  GitHub supports Subversion clients, which may produce some unexpected results if you're using both Git and SVN on the same project. If you've manipulated Git's commit history, those same commits will always remain within SVN's history. If you accidentally committed some sensitive data, we have an article that will help you remove it from Git's history.

      "body": " Tip: Press \"?\" on any page in GitHub to see all available keyboard shortcuts.   File views show the latest version on a branch When viewing a file on GitHub, you usually see the version at the current head of a branch. For example:  https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/README.md  refers to GitHub's hubot repository, and shows the master branch's current version of the README.md file. The version of a file at the head of branch can change as new commits are made, so if you were to copy the normal URL, the file contents might not be the same when someone looks at it later.  Press y to permalink to a file in a specific commit For a permanent link to the specific version of a file that you see, instead of using a branch name in the URL (i.e. the master part in the example above), put a commit id. This will permanently link to the exact version of the file in that commit. For example:  https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/ed25584f5ac2520a6c28547ffd0961c7abd7ea49/README.md  replaces master with a specific commit id and the file content will not change. Looking up the commit SHA by hand is inconvenient, however, so as a shortcut you can type y to automatically update the URL to the permalink version. Then you can copy the URL knowing that anyone you share it with will see exactly what you saw.  Tip: You can put any identifier that can be resolved to a commit in the URL, including branch names, specific commit SHAs, or tags!

      "body": "This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a counter notice to a DMCA takedown request. If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy. If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice. If you do, we will wait 10-14 days and then re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action against you before then. Our counter-notice form, set forth below, is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: http://www.copyright.gov. As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.  Before You Start Tell the Truth. The DMCA requires that you swear to your counter notice under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability—that is, you could get sued for money damages. Investigate. Submitting a DMCA counter notice can have real legal consequences. If the complaining party disagrees that their takedown notice was mistaken, they might decide to file a lawsuit against you to keep the content disabled. You should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the takedown notice and probably talk to a lawyer before submitting a counter notice. You Must Have a Good Reason to Submit a Counter Notice. In order to file a counter notice, you must have \"a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" (U.S. Code, Title 17, Section 512(g).) Whether you decide to explain why you believe there was a mistake is up to you and your lawyer, but you do need to identify a mistake before you submit a counter notice. In the past, we have received counter notices citing mistakes in the takedown notice such as: the complaining party doesn't have the copyright; I have a license; the code has been released under an open-source license that permits my use; or the complaint doesn't account for the fact that my use is protected by the fair-use doctrine. Of course, there could be other defects with the takedown notice. Copyright Laws Are Complicated. Sometimes a takedown notice might allege infringement in a way that seems odd or indirect. Copyright laws are complicated and can lead to some unexpected results. In some cases a takedown notice might allege that your source code infringes because of what it can do after it is compiled and run. For example:  The notice may claim that your software is used to circumvent access controls to copyrighted works.  Sometimes distributing software can be copyright infringement, if you induce end users to use the software to infringe copyrighted works. A copyright complaint might also be based on non-literal copying of design elements in the software, rather than the source code itself — in other words, someone has sent a notice saying they think your design looks too similar to theirs.  These are just a few examples of the complexities of copyright law. Since there are many nuances to the law and some unsettled questions in these types of cases, it is especially important to get professional advice if the infringement allegations do not seem straightforward. A Counter Notice Is A Legal Statement. We require you to fill out all fields of a counter notice completely, because a counter notice is a legal statement — not just to us, but to the complaining party. As we mentioned above, if the complaining party wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. In other words, you might get sued (and you consent to that in the counter notice). Your Counter Notice Will Be Published. As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable counter notices at https://github.com/github/dmca. Please also note that, although we will only publicly publish redacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it. If you are concerned about your privacy, you may have a lawyer or other legal representative file the counter notice on your behalf. GitHub Isn't The Judge. GitHub exercises little discretion in this process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury. Additional Resources. If you need additional help, there are many self-help resources online. Lumen has an informative set of guides on copyright and DMCA safe harbor. If you are involved with an open-source project in need of legal advice, you can contact the Software Freedom Law Center. And if you think you have a particularly challenging case, non-profit organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation may also be willing to help directly or refer you to a lawyer.  Your Counter Notice Must...  Include the following statement: \"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.\" We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete counter notice if you don't include this statement; however, we will know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so. Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared. The disabled content should have been identified by URL in the takedown notice. You simply need to copy the URL(s) that you want to challenge. Provide your contact information. Include your email address, name, telephone number, and physical address. Include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" You may also choose to communicate the reasons why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification. If you think of your counter notice as a \"note\" to the complaining party, this is a chance to explain why they should not take the next step and file a lawsuit in response. This is yet another reason to work with a lawyer when submitting a counter notice. Include the following statement: \"I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.\" Include your physical or electronic signature.   How to Submit Your Counter Notice The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our Copyright claims form. You can also send an email notification to copyright@github.com. You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message. If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it—and the 10-14 day waiting period starts from when we receive your counter notice. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is: GitHub, Inc Attn: DMCA Agent 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St San Francisco, CA. 94107 ",

      "body": " Choosing the right license We created choosealicense.com, to help you understand how to license your code. A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code, so it's important to make an informed decision. You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. If you're creating an open source project, we strongly encourage you to include an open source license. The Open Source Guide provides additional guidance on choosing the correct license for your project.  Note: If you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, according to the Terms of Service, other GitHub users have the right to view and fork your repository within the GitHub site. If you have already created a public repository and no longer want users to have access to it, you can make your repository private. When you convert a public repository to a private repository, existing forks or local copies created by other users will still exist. For more information, see \"Making a public repository private.\"   Determining the location of your license Most people place their license text in a file named LICENSE.txt (or LICENSE.md) in the root of the repository; here's an example from Hubot. Some projects include information about their license in their README. For example, a project's README may include a note saying \"This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\" As a best practice, we encourage you to include the license file with your project.  Searching GitHub by license type You can filter repositories based on their license or license family using the license qualifier and the exact license keyword:    License License keyword     Academic Free License v3.0 afl-3.0   Apache license 2.0 apache-2.0   Artistic license 2.0 artistic-2.0   Boost Software License 1.0 bsl-1.0   BSD 2-clause \"Simplified\" license bsd-2-clause   BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" license bsd-3-clause   BSD 3-clause Clear license bsd-3-clause-clear   Creative Commons license family cc   Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal cc0-1.0   Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 cc-by-4.0   Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 cc-by-sa-4.0   Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License wtfpl   Educational Community License v2.0 ecl-2.0   Eclipse Public License 1.0 epl-1.0   European Union Public License 1.1 eupl-1.1   GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 agpl-3.0   GNU General Public License family gpl   GNU General Public License v2.0 gpl-2.0   GNU General Public License v3.0 gpl-3.0   GNU Lesser General Public License family lgpl   GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 lgpl-2.1   GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 lgpl-3.0   ISC isc   LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c lppl-1.3c   Microsoft Public License ms-pl   MIT mit   Mozilla Public License 2.0 mpl-2.0   Open Software License 3.0 osl-3.0   PostgreSQL License postgresql   SIL Open Font License 1.1 ofl-1.1   University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License ncsa   The Unlicense unlicense   zLib License zlib    When you search by a family license, your results will include all licenses in that family. For example, when you use the query license:gpl, your results will include repositories licensed under GNU General Public License v2.0 and GNU General Public License v3.0. For more information, see \"Searching for repositories.\"  Detecting a license The open source Ruby gem Licensee compares the repository's LICENSE file to a short list of known licenses. Licensee also provides the Licenses API and gives us insight into how repositories on GitHub are licensed. If your repository is using a license that isn't listed on the Choose a License website, you can request including the license. If your repository is using a license that is listed on the Choose a License website and it's not displaying clearly at the top of the repository page, it may contain multiple licenses or other complexity. To have your license detected, simplify your LICENSE file and note the complexity somewhere else, such as your repository's README file.  Applying a license to a repository with an existing license The license picker is only available when you create a new project on GitHub. You can manually add a license using the browser. For more information on adding a license to a repository, see \"Adding a license to a repository.\"   Disclaimer The goal of GitHub's open source licensing efforts is to provide a starting point to help you make an informed choice. GitHub displays license information to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them. We hope it helps, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers and that we make mistakes like everyone else. For that reason, GitHub provides the information on an “as-is” basis and makes no warranties regarding any information or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from using the license information.

      "category_url": "/categories/searching-for-information-on-github",
      "url": "/articles/searching-code",
      "body": "You can search for code globally across all of GitHub, or search for code within a particular repository or organization. To search for code across all public repositories, you must be signed in to a GitHub account. For more information, see \"About searching on GitHub.\" You can only search code using these code search qualifiers. Search qualifiers specifically for repositories, users, or commits, will not work when searching for code.  Tips:  For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see \"Understanding the search syntax\". Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    In this article:  Considerations for code search Search by the file contents or file path Search within a user's or organization's repositories Search by location Search by language Search by file size Search by filename Search by file extension   Considerations for code search Due to the complexity of searching code, there are some restrictions on how searches are performed:  You must be signed in to search for code across all public repositories. Code in forks is only searchable if the fork has more stars than the parent repository. Forks with fewer stars than the parent repository are not indexed for code search. To include forks with more stars than their parent in the search results, you will need to add fork:true or fork:only to your query. For more information, see \"Searching in forks.\" Only the default branch is indexed for code search. In most cases, this will be the master branch. Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable. Only repositories with fewer than 500,000 files are searchable. Users who are signed in can search all public repositories.  Except with filename searches, you must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for language:javascript is not valid, while amazing language:javascript is. At most, search results can show two fragments from the same file, but there may be more results within the file. You can't use the following wildcard characters as part of your search query: . , : ; / \\ ` ' \" = * ! ? # $ &amp; + ^ | ~ &lt; &gt; ( ) { } [ ]. The search will simply ignore these symbols.   Search by the file contents or file path With the in qualifier you can restrict your search to the contents of the source code file, the file path, or both. When you omit this qualifier, only the file contents are searched.    Qualifier Example     in:file  octocat in:file matches code where \"octocat\" appears in the file contents.   in:path  octocat in:path matches code where \"octocat\" appears in the file path.     octocat in:file,path matches code where \"octocat\" appears in the file contents or the file path.     Search within a user's or organization's repositories To search the code in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the user or org qualifier. To search the code in a specific repository, you can use the repo qualifier.    Qualifier Example     user:USERNAME  user:defunkt extension:rb matches code from @defunkt that ends in .rb.   org:ORGNAME  org:github extension:js matches code from GitHub that ends in .js.   repo:USERNAME/REPOSITORY  repo:mozilla/shumway extension:as matches code from @mozilla's shumway project that ends in .as.     Search by file location You can use the path qualifier to search for source code that appears at a specific location in a repository. Use path:/ to search for files that are located at the root level of a repository. Or specify a directory name or the path to a directory to search for files that are located within that directory or any of its subdirectories.    Qualifier Example     path:/  octocat filename:readme path:/ matches readme files with the word \"octocat\" that are located at the root level of a repository.   path:DIRECTORY  form path:cgi-bin language:perl matches Perl files with the word \"form\" in a cgi-bin directory, or in any of its subdirectories.   path:PATH/TO/DIRECTORY  console path:app/public language:javascript matches JavaScript files with the word \"console\" in an app/public directory, or in any of its subdirectories (even if they reside in app/public/js/form-validators).     Search by language You can search for code based on what language it's written in.    Qualifier Example     language:LANGUAGE  element language:xml size:100 matches code with the word \"element\" that's marked as being XML and has exactly 100 bytes.     display language:scss matches code with the word \"display,\" that's marked as being SCSS.     org:mozilla language:markdown matches code from all @mozilla's repositories that's marked as Markdown.     Search by file size You can use the size qualifier to search for source code based on the size of the file where the code exists. The size qualifier uses greater than, less than, and range qualifiers to filter results based on the byte size of the file in which the code is found.    Qualifier Example     size:n  function size:&gt;10000 language:python matches code with the word \"function,\" written in Python, in files that are larger than 10 KB.     Search by filename The filename qualifier matches code files with a certain filename. You can also find a file in a repository using the file finder. For more information, see \"Finding files on GitHub.\"    Qualifier Example     filename:FILENAME  filename:linguist matches files named \"linguist.\"     filename:.vimrc commands matches .vimrc files with the word \"commands.\"     filename:test_helper path:test language:ruby matches Ruby files named test_helper within the test directory.

You may only provision one Seat per User across GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For clarity, once you provision a Seat to a User, you will not be authorized to bifurcate the Seat so that one User can use a Seat on GitHub Enterprise Server while another User uses the same Seat on GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Other capitalized terms used but not defined in these supplemental terms have the meanings assigned to them in the Microsoft Customer Agreement.  A. GitHub Enterprise Server Terms The terms in this Section A govern Customer's use of GitHub Enterprise Server, including any related Support.  1. Definitions. \"Documentation\" means any manuals, documentation and other supporting materials related to the Software (as defined below) that GitHub provides or makes available to Customer. \"License\" means a data file used by the Software's access control mechanism that allows Customer to install, operate, and use the Software. \"License Key\" means the means by which a License is delivered via a secure, password-protected website. \"Release\" means a Software release that GitHub makes generally available to its customers, along with any corresponding changes to Documentation, that is comprised of an enhancement, new feature, or new functionality, generally indicated by a change in the digit to the right of the first decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to x.y.x) or to the left of the first decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to y.x.x). \"Software\" means GitHub's proprietary GitHub Enterprise Server software. Software includes any Documentation, as well as any Updates to the Software that GitHub provides to Customer or that Customer can access under the Microsoft Customer Agreement and this Section A. \"Support\" has the meaning set forth in Section 8 below. \"Update\" means a Software release that GitHub makes generally available to its customers, along with any corresponding changes to Documentation, that is comprised of an error correction or bug fix, generally indicated by a change in the digit to the right of the second decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to x.x.y). \"User\" means a single person or machine account that initiates the execution of the Software or interacts with or directs the Software in the performance of its functions. The number of Users should not exceed the number of Seats that Customer has licensed.  2. License Grant. Subject to Customer's compliance with the Microsoft Customer Agreement and this Section A, GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to install and use a single production License of the Software for its internal business purposes, in accordance with the Documentation, and only for the number and type of Seats stated in Customer's order. Customer may make copies of the Software for non-production purposes only, such as for testing, staging or quality assurance, provided that Customer reproduces all copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on the original copy of the Software. Customer's Affiliates, agents and contractors (together, \"Authorized Third Parties\") may also use the Software, so long as they are using it on Customer's behalf and Customer agrees to remain fully responsible for such Authorized Third Parties' behavior under the Microsoft Customer Agreement and this Section A.  3. Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted by applicable law or by applicable third-party license, and in addition to any license restrictions set forth in the Microsoft Customer Agreement, Customer and its Affiliates must not and must not allow any third party to: (i) disclose or permit any third party to access the Software, except as expressly permitted in this Section A; (ii) hack or modify the License Key, or avoid or change any license registration process; (iii) modify or create derivative works of the Software, or merge the Software with other software; (iv) modify, obscure, or delete any proprietary rights notices included in or on the Software or Documentation; or (v) otherwise use or copy the Software in any manner not expressly permitted by this Section A.  4. Modifications.

In addition to this Section A, Customer's access to and use of GitHub Connect will also be governed by the terms of Section B below. Customer may not use GitHub Connect to violate any terms of Section B below. Any use of GitHub Connect that violates any such terms will also be a violation of this Section A. GitHub Connect may be used for performing automated tasks. In addition, multiple Users may direct certain actions with GitHub Connect. Customer is responsible for actions that are performed on or through Customer's accounts. GitHub may collect information about how Customer uses GitHub Connect to provide and improve the feature. By using GitHub Connect, Customer authorizes GitHub to collect protected data, which includes private repository data and User Personal Information (as defined in GitHub's Privacy Statement), from Customer's GitHub Enterprise Server account. Customer also authorizes the transfer of identifying instance information to GitHub through GitHub Connect, which information is governed by GitHub's Privacy Statement.   10. Limited Software Warranty. GitHub warrants that, for ninety (90) days from the date it is made available for initial download, the unmodified Software will substantially conform to its Documentation. GitHub does not warrant that Customer's use of the Software will be uninterrupted, or that the operation of the Software will be error-free. This warranty will not apply if Customer modifies or uses the Software in any way that is not expressly permitted by this Section A and the Documentation. GitHub's only obligation, and Customer's only remedy, for any breach of this limited warranty will be as set forth in the Microsoft Customer Agreement.  B.

Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine Account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. Customer may maintain no more than one free machine Account in addition to Customer's free User Account. One person or entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if Customer chooses to control a machine Account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). Customer may not create an Account for the use of any User under the age of 13. GitHub does not target the Service to children under 13, and it does not permit any Users under 13 on the Service. If GitHub learns of any User under the age of 13, it will terminate that User's Account immediately.

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to Customer's use of the Service. For example, Customer may be a member of an organization with its own terms or license agreements; Customer may download an application that integrates with the Service; or Customer may use the Service to authenticate to another service. While the Microsoft Customer Agreement and this Section B comprise GitHub's full agreement with Customer with respect to Customer's use of GitHub Enterprise Cloud, other parties' terms govern their relationships with Customer. If Customer is a government User or otherwise accessing or using any portion of the Service in a government capacity, the Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to Customer, and Customer agrees to its provisions.  3.

While using the Service, Customer agrees that under no circumstances, will it or its Users:  harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub and Other Users; use GitHub servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through such servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes; attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub servers in ways that could harm the Website or Service, to place undue burden on such servers through automated means, or to access the Service in ways that exceed Customer's authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); impersonate any person or entity, including any GitHub employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting Customer's identity or purpose; or violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.  3.4 Services Usage Limits. Customer will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission. 3.4 Scraping. Scraping refers to extracting data from the Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Customer may scrape the Website for the following reasons:  Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from the Website for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access. Archivists may scrape the Website for public data for archival purposes.  Customer may not scrape the Website for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Other Users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. 3.5 Privacy. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub (including, without limitation, through scraping under Section 3.4 above) must comply with GitHub's Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of User Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If Customer collects any User Personal Information from GitHub, Customer will only use such User Personal Information for the purpose for which the Other User has authorized it. Customer will reasonably secure any such User Personal Information, and will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or Other Users. 3.6 Excessive Bandwidth Use. If GitHub determines Customer's bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to Other Users, it reserves the right to suspend Customer's Account or throttle its file hosting until Customer can reduce its bandwidth consumption. 3.7 User Protection. Customer will not engage in activity that significantly harms Other Users. GitHub will resolve disputes in favor of protecting All Users as a whole.  4. User-Generated Content. 4.1 Responsibility for User-Generated Content. Customer may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. Customer is solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that it or its Users post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. GitHub is not responsible for any public display or misuse of User-Generated Content. 4.2 GitHub May Remove Content. GitHub does not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but it has the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in its sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies. 4.3 Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants. (i) Customer retains ownership of and responsibility for Customer Content. If Customer posts anything it or its Users did not create themselves and on Customer's behalf, or does not own the rights to, Customer and its Users (a) are responsible for such Customer Content, (b) will only submit Customer Content that Customer has the right to post, and (c) Customer will fully comply with any third-party licenses relating to Customer Content that Customer posts. (ii) Customer grants to GitHub and Other Users the rights set forth in Sections 4.4 through 4.6 below with respect to Customer Content. If Customer uploads Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions it needs to run the Service, no additional license is required. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections 4.4 through 4.6, and such rights will end when Customer removes Customer Content from GitHub's servers, unless Other Users have forked it. 4.4 License to GitHub. Customer grants to GitHub the right to store, parse, and display Customer Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to GitHub's database and make backups; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on GitHub's servers; show it to Customer or those Customer chooses to show it to; share it with Other Users Customer chooses to share it with; and perform it, in case Customer Content is something like music or video. These rights apply to both public and private repositories. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Customer Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of the provision of the Service. 4.5 License to Other Users. (i) Any User-Generated Content Customer or its Users post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to Other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting Customer's repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer agrees to allow Other Users to view and \"fork\" such repositories (i.e., Other Users may make their own copies of Customer Content from Customer's repositories in repositories they control). (ii) If Customer sets its pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer grants to Other Users a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Customer Content through the Service and to reproduce Customer Content solely on the Service as permitted through functionality provided by GitHub (for example, through forking). Customer may grant further rights if Customer adopts a license. If Customer is uploading Content it did not create or own, Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Content it uploads is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to Other Users. 4.6 Contributions Under Repository License. Whenever Customer makes a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, Customer licenses such contribution under the same terms, and Customer agrees that it has the right to license such contribution under those terms. If Customer has a separate agreement to license such contribution under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.  5. Private Repositories. 5.1 Control of Private Repositories. Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow a User to control access to Content. 5.2 Confidentiality of Private Repositories. The parties' obligations with respect to Confidential Information are set forth in the Microsoft Customer Agreement. GitHub considers the contents of Customer's private repositories to be Customer's Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub's only obligations with respect to Confidential Information are to protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that GitHub would use to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. 5.3 Access. GitHub employees may only access the content of Customer's private repositories in the following situations:  With Customer's consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, it will only do so with the owner's consent and knowledge. When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems and Service.  Customer may choose to enable additional access to its private repositories. For example, Customer may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Customer Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat Customer Content in private repositories as Customer's Confidential Information. If those services or features require rights in addition to those needed to provide the Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights. 5.4 Exclusions. If GitHub has reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of law, the Microsoft Customer Agreement or this Section B, GitHub has the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, GitHub may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of Customer's private repositories.  6. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy. If Customer is a copyright owner and believes that content on the Website violates its copyright, Customer may contact GitHub in accordance with GitHub's Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy, by notifying GitHub via its DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. GitHub will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.  7. GitHub Trademarks and Logos. If Customer would like to use GitHub's trademarks, it must follow all of GitHub's trademark guidelines, including those on the logos page.  8. API Terms. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of Customer's Account access to the API. GitHub, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. GitHub will make a reasonable attempt to warn Customer via email prior to suspension. Customer may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations. Customer may not use the API to download data or Content from the Website for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling User Personal Information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of the GitHub API is subject to this Section B and the GitHub Privacy Statement. GitHub may offer subscription-based access to its API if Customer requires high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.  9. Additional Terms for GitHub Pages. Each Account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service (as further described at https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for All Users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see the GitHub Pages guidelines for more information. GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub.com subdomain without liability.  10. Third-Party Applications. 10.1 Creating Applications. If Customer creates a Developer Product and makes it available for Other Users, then Customer must comply with the following requirements:  Customer must comply with this Section B and the GitHub Privacy Statement. Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, Customer must limit its usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content it collects to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection. Customer must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content. Customer must not hold itself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub's behalf, and provide sufficient notice of its privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy. Customer must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content it has collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.  10.2 Using Third-Party Applications. (i) Customer may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of Customer's repositories, including its private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through GitHub Marketplace. Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and in some cases, multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if Customer purchases and/or sets up a Developer Product on its Account, or Customer is an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then Customer will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through Customer's Account. Please see GitHub's Privacy Statement for more information about how GitHub shares data with Developer Products. (ii) GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that Customer authorize to access Customer Content. Customer's use of any third-party applications is at its sole risk. (iii) If Customer buys Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service controls such purchase. This Section B, as well as the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern Customer's use of GitHub Marketplace.  11. Advertising on GitHub. 11.1 GitHub Pages. GitHub offers Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links. 11.2 GitHub Repositories. Repositories are intended to host Content. Customer may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with its repositories, but they must be related to the project Customer is hosting on the Website. Customer may not advertise in Other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues. 11.3 Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub. Advertising Content must not violate the law or these supplemental terms, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. GitHub reserves the right to remove any advertisements that, in its sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.  12. Cancellation and Termination. 12.1 Account Cancellation. It is Customer's responsibility to properly cancel its Account with GitHub. Customer may cancel its Account at any time by going into its Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. GitHub is not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request. 12.2 Upon Cancellation or Termination. GitHub will retain and use Customer information as necessary to comply with GitHub's legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce its agreements, but barring legal requirements, GitHub will delete Customer's full profile and the Content of Customer's repositories within ninety (90) days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once Customer's Account is cancelled. GitHub will not delete Customer Content that Customer has contributed to Other Users' repositories or that Other Users have forked. Upon request, GitHub will use reasonable efforts to provide an Account owner with a copy of Customer's lawful, non-infringing Account contents after any Account closure, suspension, or downgrade. Customer must make this request within ninety (90) days of closure, suspension, or downgrade. 12.3 Termination. GitHub has the right to suspend access to all or any part of the Website or Customer's Account at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub has the right to terminate Customer's Account at any time, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days' advance notice or if Customer's Account has been suspended for more than ninety (90) days.  13. Communications with GitHub. GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages.  14. GitHub Enterprise Cloud SLA. 14.1. Uptime Guarantee and Calculation. GitHub guarantees that the Service will have a quarterly Uptime percentage of 99.95%. That means GitHub's Essential Services will not be interrupted by an Outage affecting more than 50% of Active Users, for more than .05% of the quarter. If GitHub doesn't meet such 99.95% quarterly Uptime guarantee, GitHub may issue Service Credits to Customers. GitHub's Uptime calculation is based on the percentage of successful requests it serves through its web, API, and Git client interfaces. 14.2 Exclusions from Uptime Guarantee. Exclusions from the Uptime Guarantee include Outages resulting from:  Scheduled Downtime: Customer's acts, omissions, or misuse of the Service, including violations of these supplemental terms. Failures of Customer's internet connectivity Factors outside GitHub's reasonable control, including Internet access related problems, force majeure events, and third-party services or technology Customer equipment, services, or other technology  14.3 Uptime Service Credits. If GitHub's quarterly Uptime percentage drops below the 99.95% Uptime guarantee set forth above, then Customer will be entitled to receive 25 times the amount that was paid for the Outage time that exceeds the quarterly Uptime guarantee (\"Uptime Service Credit\"), which will be applied against the Customer's next bill. Uptime Service Credits are calculated at the end of each quarter, and may only be granted upon request. To find out about GitHub's Uptime percentage, Customer may request an Uptime report at the end of each quarter. In order to be granted Uptime Service Credits, either an Account Owner or Billing Manager must send in a written request, on Customer's behalf, within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter. Uptime Service Credits may not be saved. After being granted an Uptime Service Credit, it will be automatically applied to Customer's next bill. Written requests should be sent to GitHub Support or Microsoft Support. 14.4 Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability. GitHub's Status Page is not connected to the GitHub Enterprise Cloud SLA and is not an accurate representation of GitHub's uptime for the purposes of calculating Uptime Service Credits. Service Credits are limited to thirty (30) days of paid service, per quarter. Service Credits are Customer's only remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any uptime obligations as identified in this Section B.   GITHUB DATA PROTECTION ADDENDUM  1.

Status and Compliance 2.1 Data Processing. GitHub acts as a Processor in regard to any Customer Personal Data it receives in connection with the Agreement, and GitHub will process Customer Personal Data only for Permitted Purposes in accordance with Customer's instructions as represented by the Agreement and other written communications. In the event that GitHub is unable to comply with Customer's instructions, such as due to conflicts with the Applicable Data Protection Laws, or where processing is required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws or other legal requirements, GitHub will notify Customer to the extent permissible. GitHub processes all Customer Personal Data in the United States or in the European Union; however, GitHub's subprocessors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. Additionally, GitHub acts as a Processor for any Customer Repository Data. 2.2 Data Controllers. GitHub receives Personal Data both from Customer and directly from Data Subjects who create End User accounts. Customer is a Controller only for the Customer Personal Data it transfers directly to GitHub. 2.3 GitHub Compliance. GitHub represents and warrants that it complies with Privacy Shield, which governs cross-border transfers of Personal Data. GitHub will remain certified under Privacy Shield for the duration of the Agreement, provided Privacy Shield remains a valid data transfer mechanism.

GitHub will comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to the processing of Personal Data.  3. Data Protection 3.1 Purpose Limitation. GitHub will process and communicate the Protected Data only for Permitted Purposes, unless the Parties agree in writing to an expanded purpose. 3.2 Data Quality and Proportionality. GitHub will keep the Customer Personal Data accurate and up to date, or enable Customer to do so. GitHub will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that any Protected Data it collects on Customer's behalf is adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is transferred and processed. In no event will GitHub intentionally collect Sensitive Data on Customer's behalf. Customer agrees that the GitHub Service is not intended for the storage of Sensitive Data; if Customer chooses to upload Sensitive Data to the Service, Customer must comply with Article 9 of the GDPR, or equivalent provisions in the Applicable Data Protection Laws. 3.3 Data Retention and Deletion. Upon Customer's reasonable request, unless prohibited by law, GitHub will return, destroy, or deidentify all Customer Personal Data and related data at all locations where it is stored after it is no longer needed for the Permitted Purposes within thirty days of request. GitHub may retain Customer Personal Data and related data to the extent required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, and only to the extent and for such period as required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, provided that GitHub will ensure that Customer Personal Data is processed only as necessary for the purpose specified in the Applicable Data Protection Laws and no other purpose, and Customer Personal Data remains protected by the Applicable Data Protection Laws. 3.4 Data Processing. GitHub provides the following information, required by Article 28(3) of the GDPR, regarding its processing of Customer's Protected Data: a. The subject matter and duration of the processing of Customer Personal Data are set out in the Agreement and this Addendum. b.

The categories of Data Subject to whom the Customer Personal Data relates are the Customer itself and its End Users. e. The obligations and rights of Customer are set out in the Agreement and this Addendum.  4. Security and Audit Obligations 4.1 Technical and Organizational Security Measures. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, GitHub will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the Protected Data. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with these measures and will continue to take appropriate safeguards throughout the duration of the Agreement. 4.2 Incident Response and Breach Notification. GitHub will comply with the Information Security obligations in the GitHub Security Exhibit and the Applicable Data Protection Laws, including Data Breach notification obligations. Please see Section 1.2 of the GitHub Security Exhibit regarding GitHub's responsibilities in relation to Data Breach response and notification. 4.3 GitHub Personnel. GitHub represents and warrants that it will take reasonable steps to ensure that all GitHub personnel processing Protected Data have agreed to keep the Protected Data confidential and have received adequate training on compliance with this Addendum and the Applicable Data Protection Laws. 4.4 Records. GitHub will maintain complete, accurate, and up to date written records of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of Customer containing the information required under the Applicable Data Protection Laws. To the extent that assistance does not risk the security of GitHub or the privacy rights of individual Data Subjects, GitHub will make these records available to Customer on request as reasonably required, such as to help Customer demonstrate its compliance under the Applicable Data Protection Laws. To learn more about GitHub's requirements to provide assistance in the event of a security incident, please see Section 1.2 of the GitHub Security Exhibit. 4.5 Compliance Reporting. GitHub will provide security compliance reporting in accordance with Section 2.3 of the GitHub Security Exhibit and privacy compliance reporting in accordance with Section 2.4 of the GitHub Security Exhibit. Customer agrees that any information and audit rights granted by the Applicable Data Protection Laws (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of the GDPR) will be satisfied by these compliance reports, and will only arise to the extent that GitHub's provision of a compliance report does not provide sufficient information, or to the extent that Customer must respond to a regulatory or Supervisory Authority audit. Section 3.1 of the GitHub Security Exhibit describes the parties' responsibilities in relation to a regulatory or Supervisory Authority audit. 4.6 Assistance. GitHub will provide reasonable assistance to Customer with concerns such as data privacy impact assessments, Data Subject rights requests, consultations with Supervisory Authorities, and other similar matters, in each case solely in relation to the processing of Customer's Personal Data and taking into account the nature of processing.  5. Use and Disclosure of Protected Data 5.1 No Use in Marketing. GitHub will not use the Protected Data for the purposes of advertising third-party content, and will not sell the Protected Data to any third party except as part of a merger or acquisition. 5.2 GitHub Privacy Statement. The GitHub Privacy Statement, publicly available at https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/, provides detailed notice of GitHub's privacy and data use practices, including its use of cookies, its dispute resolution process, and further details about GitHub's GDPR compliance.  6. Subprocessing and Onward Transfer 6.1 Protection of Data. GitHub is liable for onward transfers of Protected Data to its subprocessors, such as its third-party payment processor. In the event that GitHub does transfer the Protected Data to a third-party subprocessor, or GitHub installs, uses, or enables a third party or third-party services to process the Protected Data on GitHub's behalf, GitHub will ensure that the third-party subprocessor is contractually bound to comply with or provide at least the same level of confidentiality, security, and privacy protection as is required of subprocessors by the Privacy Shield Principles and the Applicable Data Protection Laws. 6.2 Acceptance of GitHub Subprocessors. Customer authorizes GitHub to appoint (and permit each subprocessor appointed in accordance with this Section 6 to appoint) subprocessors in accordance with Section 6 and any other restrictions in the Agreement. GitHub may continue to use those subprocessors currently engaged as of the Effective Date of this Addendum. 6.3 General Consent for Onward Subprocessing. Customer provides a general consent for GitHub to engage onward subprocessors, conditional on GitHub's compliance with the following requirements: a. Any onward subprocessor must agree in writing to only process data in a country that the European Commission has declared to have an \"adequate\" level of protection; or to only process data on terms equivalent to the Standard Contractual Clauses, or pursuant to a Binding Corporate Rules approval granted by competent European data protection authorities, or pursuant to a compliant US-EU Privacy Shield certification; and b. GitHub will restrict the onward subprocessor's access to Customer Personal Data only to what is strictly necessary to perform its services, and GitHub will prohibit the subprocessor from processing the Customer Personal Data for any other purpose. 6.4 Disclosure of Subprocessor Agreements. GitHub maintains a list of onward subprocessors it has engaged to process Customer Personal Data at https://help.github.com/articles/github-subprocessors-and-cookies/, including the categories of Customer Personal Data processed, a description of the type of processing the subprocessor performs, and the location of its processing. GitHub will, upon Customer's written request, provide Customer with this list of subprocessors and the terms under which they process the Customer Personal Data. Pursuant to subprocessor confidentiality restrictions, GitHub may remove any confidential or commercially sensitive information before providing the list and the terms to Customer. In the event that GitHub cannot disclose confidential or sensitive information to Customer, the Parties agree that GitHub will provide all information it reasonably can in connection with its subprocessing agreements. 6.5 Objection to Subprocessors. GitHub will provide thirty days' prior written notice of the addition or removal of any subprocessor, including the categories listed in Section 6.4, by announcing changes on its https://github.com/github/site-policy site. If Customer has a reasonable objection to GitHub's engagement of a new subprocessor, Customer must notify GitHub promptly in writing. Where possible, GitHub will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative solution to the affected Service to avoid processing of data by the objectionable subprocessor. In the event that GitHub is unable to provide an alternative solution and the Parties cannot resolve the conflict within ninety days, Customer may terminate the Agreement.  7. Termination 7.1 Suspension. In the event that GitHub is in breach of its obligations to maintain an adequate level of security or privacy protection, Customer may temporarily suspend the transfer of all Customer Personal Data or prohibit collection and processing of Customer Personal Data on Customer's behalf until the breach is repaired or the Agreement is terminated. 7.2 Termination with Cause. In addition to any termination rights Customer has under the Agreement, Customer may terminate the Agreement without prejudice to any other claims at law or in equity in the event that: a. GitHub notifies Customer that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations; b. the transfer, collection, or processing of all Customer Personal Data has been temporarily suspended for longer than one month pursuant to Section 7.1; c. GitHub is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or representations under this Addendum; d. GitHub is no longer carrying on business, is dissolved, enters receivership, or a winding up order is made on behalf of GitHub; or e. Customer objects to a subprocessor pursuant to Section 6.5, and GitHub has not been able to provide an alternative solution within ninety days. 7.3 Breach. Failure to comply with the material provisions of this Addendum is considered a material breach under the Agreement. 7.4 Failure to perform. In the event that changes in law or regulation render performance of this Addendum impossible or commercially unreasonable, the Parties may renegotiate the Addendum in good faith. If renegotiation would not cure the impossibility, or if the Parties cannot reach an agreement, the Parties may terminate the Agreement after thirty days. 7.5 Notification. In the event that GitHub determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Addendum, GitHub will notify Customer in writing immediately. 7.6 Modifications. GitHub may modify this Addendum from time to time as required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, with thirty days' notice to Customer. 7.7 Termination Requirements. Upon Termination, GitHub must: a. take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop processing the Customer Personal Data; b. within ninety days of termination, delete or deidentify any Customer Personal Data GitHub stores on Customer's behalf pursuant to Section 3.3; and c. provide Customer with reasonable assurance that GitHub has complied with its obligations in Section 7.7.  8.

      "body": "Welcome to GitHub Marketplace (\"Marketplace\")! We're happy you're here. Please read these Terms of Service (\"Marketplace Terms\") carefully before accessing or using GitHub Marketplace. GitHub Marketplace is a platform that allows you to purchase developer products (for free or for a charge) that can be used with your GitHub.com account (\"Developer Products\"). Although sold by GitHub, Inc. (\"GitHub\", \"we\", \"us\"), Developer Products may be developed and maintained by either GitHub or by third-party software providers, and may require you to agree to a separate terms of service. Your use and/or purchase of Developer Products is subject to these Marketplace Terms and to the applicable fees and may also be subject to additional terms as provided by the third party licensor of that Developer Product (the \"Product Provider\"). By using Marketplace, you are agreeing to be bound by these Marketplace Terms. Effective Date: October 11, 2017  A. GitHub.com's Terms of Service Marketplace is provided by GitHub, and is governed by either the Terms of Service or the Corporate Terms of Service (\"GitHub Terms\"), depending on the type of account you're on, as well as these Marketplace Terms. If you configure the Developer Products to work with one or more accounts on the GitHub.com website, your use of the Developer Products will also be governed by your applicable GitHub Terms. Any capitalized terms not defined in this document will be defined in your applicable GitHub Terms. You may not use a Developer Product to violate your applicable GitHub Terms. Many of these Developer Products are used exclusively for performing automated tasks. In addition, multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your account, or you are an owner of an account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through your account.  B. Use Requirements In order to use Marketplace, you must be 13 years of age or older (if you live in the United States; if you live in another country, you must comply with your country's minimum age laws), have a valid GitHub account, and have agreed to your applicable GitHub Terms and these Marketplace Terms. If you are agreeing to these Marketplace Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Marketplace on its behalf to these Marketplace Terms. If you do not have authority, you must not accept these Marketplace Terms and you may not use the Marketplace services.  C. Developer Products and Product Providers If you install and/or purchase a Developer Product, then you are purchasing the Developer Products from GitHub and you are required to make the related payments directly to GitHub. However, you are receiving access to and the rights to use that Developer Product from a Product Provider, not from GitHub (unless it's a GitHub-owned Developer Product). The Product Provider is solely responsible for the Developer Product it provides, the content therein, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Developer Product or your use of that Developer Product. We are not a party to the agreement between you and the Product Provider with respect to that Developer Product. We are not responsible for that Developer Product, the content in it, or any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Developer Product or your use of that Developer Product. However, we are a third party beneficiary of the agreement between you and the Product Provider for each Developer Product, and we will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce that agreement against you as a third party beneficiary.  D. Payment, Billing Schedule, and Cancellation All payments for Developer Products will go through GitHub. The terms of your payment and fees will be governed by Section L. Payment, or the analogous section of your applicable GitHub Terms. By using the Marketplace, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your purchase of the Developer Product. Each purchase is an electronic contract between you and GitHub, and you and the Product Provider. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for purchases of Developer Products. If you are only purchasing free Developer Products, you are not required to provide payment information. Billing Schedule; No Refunds. Your payment schedule is determined by the payment schedule you chose when you created your GitHub account (e.g. free, monthly, annual). For monthly or yearly payment plans, Marketplace purchases are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. If you would like to cancel the Developer Product services, you can do so by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. If you would have a question, concern, or dispute regarding your billing, please contact GitHub Support.  E. Your Data and GitHub's Privacy Policy Privacy. When you purchase or subscribe to a Developer Product, GitHub must share certain Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement) with the Product Provider in order to provide you with the Developer Product, regardless of your privacy settings. Depending on the requirements of the Developer Product you choose, GitHub may share as little as your user account name, ID, and primary email address or as much as access to the content in your repositories, including the ability to read and modify your private data. You will be able to view the scope of the permissions the Developer Product is requesting, and accept or deny them, when you grant it authorization via OAuth. In line with GitHub's Privacy Statement, we will only provide the Product Provider with the minimum amount of information necessary for the purpose of the transaction. If you cancel your Developer Product services and revoke access through your account settings, the Product Provider will no longer be able to access your account. The Product Provider is responsible for deleting your Personal Information from its systems within its defined window. Please contact the Product Provider to ensure that your account has been properly terminated. Data Security Disclaimer. When you purchase or subscribe to a Developer Product, the Developer Product security and their custodianship of your data is the responsibility of the Product Provider. You are responsible for understanding the security considerations of the purchase and use of the Developer Product for your own security, risk and compliance considerations.  F. Rights to Developer Products The rights granted to you to use any Developer Product are personal to you, and are not transferrable to any third parties, such as your end users. Any rights to provide or resell Developer Products to third parties must be granted directly by the Product Provider.  G. Updates to Developer Products From time to time, GitHub.com may check with remote servers (hosted by GitHub or by third parties) for available updates to Developer Products, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. You agree that such updates will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.  H. Developer Product Blocking GitHub may block a Developer Product from our servers, or disable its functionality, for legal or policy reasons. In the event that we must block or disable a Developer Product, we will work with the Product Provider to notify affected users.  I. Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability; Release and Indemnification Disclaimer. Your use of Marketplace and any Developer Products obtained through Marketplace is at your sole risk. Other than as expressly stated, GitHub provides Marketplace and Developer Products “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” GitHub does not make or imply any warranties or commitments about Marketplace and Developer Products, including but not limited to the specific functionality available through Marketplace and Developer Products, their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your need. We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, Marketplace (or any part of it) with or without notice. Limitation of Liability. You understand and agree that GitHub will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from: (i) your use or inability to use Marketplace or any Developer Products; (ii) any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of Marketplace or Developer Products; (iii) Marketplace generally or the software or systems that make Marketplace available; (iv) unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; (v) statements or conduct of any third party, Product Provider, or Developer Product on Marketplace; (vi) any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of Marketplace; or (vii) any other matter relating to Marketplace. Release and Indemnification. If you have a dispute with one or more Product Providers, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of Marketplace, including but not limited to your violation of these Marketplace Terms, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.  J. Miscellanea  Governing Law. You agree that these Marketplace Terms and your use of the Developer Products are governed under California law and any dispute related to the Developer Products must be brought in a tribunal of competent jurisdiction located in or near San Francisco, California. Non-Assignability. GitHub may assign or delegate these Marketplace Terms and/or the GitHub's Privacy Statement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Marketplace Terms or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival. If any part of these Marketplace Terms are held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Marketplace Terms will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. The failure of GitHub to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Marketplace Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Our rights under these Marketplace Terms will survive any termination of these Marketplace Terms. No Modifications; Complete Agreement. These Marketplace Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version. These Marketplace Terms, together with GitHub's Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us. These Marketplace Terms supersede any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms. Section Headings.

If you have a very good reason you must use sudo, then ensure you are using it with every command (it's probably just better to use su to get a shell as root at that point). If you generate SSH keys without sudo and then try to use a command like sudo git push, you won't be using the same keys that you generated.  Check that you are connecting to the correct server Typing is hard, we all know it. Pay attention to what you type; you won't be able to connect to \"githib.com\" or \"guthub.com\". In some cases, a corporate network may cause issues resolving the DNS record as well. To make sure you are connecting to the right domain, you can enter the following command:  ssh -vT git@github.com OpenSSH_5.6p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/you/.ssh/config debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to github.com [IP ADDRESS] port 22.  The connection should be made on port 22, unless you're overriding settings to use SSH over HTTPS.  Always use the \"git\" user All connections, including those for remote URLs, must be made as the \"git\" user. If you try to connect with your GitHub username, it will fail:  ssh -T GITHUB-USERNAME@github.com Permission denied (publickey).  If your connection failed and you're using a remote URL with your GitHub username, you can change the remote URL to use the \"git\" user.

It also comes with the Git Bash tool, which is the preferred way of running git commands on Windows.   If you are using Git Bash, turn on ssh-agent:  # start the ssh-agent in the background eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\" Agent pid 59566  If you are using another terminal prompt, such as Git for Windows, turn on ssh-agent:  # start the ssh-agent in the background eval $(ssh-agent -s) Agent pid 59566    Verify that you have a private key generated and loaded into SSH.

If it does not print anything, you will need to generate a new SSH key and associate it with GitHub.  Tip: On most systems the default private keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity) are automatically added to the SSH authentication agent. You shouldn't need to run ssh-add path/to/key unless you override the file name when you generate a key.   Getting more details You can also check that the key is being used by trying to connect to git@github.com:  ssh -vT git@github.com ... debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 ... debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Trying private key: /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/you/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: No more authentication methods to try. Permission denied (publickey).  In that example, we did not have any keys for SSH to use. The \"-1\" at the end of the \"identity file\" lines means SSH couldn't find a file to use. Later on, the \"Trying private key\" lines also indicate that no file was found. If a file existed, those lines would be \"1\" and \"Offering public key\", respectively:  ssh -vT git@github.com ... debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 ... debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa   Verify the public key is attached to your account You must provide your public key to GitHub to establish a secure connection.

      "body": " Tip: If you've recently changed or removed your custom domain and can't access the new URL in your browser, you may need to clear your browser's cache to reach the new custom domain. For more information on clearing your cache, see your browser's help site.   In this guide:  GitHub repository setup errors DNS configuration errors Unsupported custom domain name HTTPS errors URL formatting error on Linux   GitHub repository setup errors  Tip: Custom domains are stored in a CNAME file in the root of your repository. You can add or update your custom domain through your repository settings. You can also edit the file directly to update your custom domain, although we recommend the procedure in \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"   The CNAME file isn't properly formatted  The CNAME filename must be uppercase Only the bare domain or subdomain should be listed, e.g., example.com or blog.example.com, not https://example.com.  For more information on setting up your custom domain, see \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"  Multiple domains in CNAME file A CNAME file can contain only one domain. To point multiple domains to the same Page, set up redirects through your DNS provider.  CNAME already taken If your custom domain is already used by another GitHub Pages site, you will receive a page build warning. When you add or edit your custom domain in your GitHub Pages site's repository settings, we automatically create a CNAME file in the root of your repository. A custom domain in a CNAME file can only be used once. Here are some examples of when you'll receive a page build warning for a duplicate custom domain:  If you have an apex domain such as example.com in your CNAME file, this means that either example.com or its www subdomain (www.example.com) has been used in a CNAME file in another repository and is being used by the corresponding GitHub Pages site. Likewise, if you have a www subdomain such as www.example.com in your CNAME file, this means that either www.example.com or its apex domain (example.com) has been used in a CNAME file in another repository and is being used by the corresponding GitHub Pages site.  If you own the other GitHub Pages repository that is using your custom domain in its CNAME file, then you must remove the custom domain from your other repository's CNAME file before you can use it in a different pages site repository. To remove the custom domain from a different GitHub Pages site repository you own, you can add a different custom domain to your GitHub Pages site or just remove your old custom domain. If you don't own the repository that contains the CNAME file with your custom domain, try to contact the owner and ask them to update their custom domain. If you're unsure which repository contains the CNAME file with your custom domain, contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.  Reached limit for User or Organization pages site You can only create one User or Organization pages site per GitHub account. For instance, there can only be one Organization pages site per organization account. Likewise, there can only be one User pages site per individual user account. Project pages sites are unlimited.  DNS configuration errors  Tip: If you have trouble pointing your GitHub Pages default domain to your custom domain, then contact your DNS provider for help. They can help confirm that you have configured your custom domain correctly.   DNS record doesn't point to GitHub's server In order to serve the Page, your DNS records must point to GitHub's server. To confirm that your custom domain points to GitHub's servers, use the dig command with your custom domain. The dig command shows you where your custom domain points. For example:  dig example.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd example.com. 3600 IN A 185.199.108.153  In the example above, example.com points to the IP address 185.199.108.153. If you configured A records through your DNS provider, your A records must point your custom domain to the following IP addresses:  185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153   Notes:  You may see a different IP address, since we serve Pages with a global Content Delivery Network. Use dig username.github.io to see the full resolution path. Note that DNS caching may cause a delay. If you're using an A record that points to 192.30.252.153 or 192.30.252.154, you'll need to update your DNS settings for your site to be available over HTTPS or served with a Content Delivery Network. For more information, see \"HTTPS errors.\" If you're using an A record that points to 207.97.227.245 or 204.232.175.78, you'll need to update your DNS settings, as we no longer serve Pages directly from those servers.   If you configured ALIAS, ANAME, or CNAME records through your DNS provider, then your DNS record should point to your GitHub Pages default domain, such as YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io. Your default GitHub Pages domain is determined by the type of pages site you have. For examples, see this domain chart. If you need help creating these records, contact your DNS provider as they should have the most detailed instructions. For some guidelines on configuring a DNS record with DNS providers, see \"Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages.\"  Unsupported custom domain name If your custom domain is unsupported then you may need to change your custom domain. You can also contact your DNS provider to see if they offer domain name forwarding services to redirect your site to an unsupported custom domain. Unsupported custom domains include:  using more than one apex domain (example.com and anotherexample.com) using more than one www subdomain (www.example.com and www.anotherexample.com) combination of an apex domain and custom subdomain (example.com and docs.example.com)   Danger: Do not use wildcard DNS records (e.g., *.example.com) with GitHub Pages! A wildcard DNS record will allow anyone to host a GitHub Pages site at one of your subdomains.  For a list of supported custom domains, see \"About supported custom domains.\"  HTTPS errors GitHub Pages sites using custom domains that are correctly configured with CNAME, ALIAS, ANAME, or A DNS records can be accessed over HTTPS. For more information, see \"Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS.\" It can take up to an hour for your GitHub Pages site to become available over HTTPS after you add and correctly configure your custom domain. After updating existing DNS settings, you may need to remove and re-add your custom domain to your GitHub account to trigger the process of enabling HTTPS. For more information, see \"Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages.\" If you've chosen to use Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) records, at least one CAA record must exist with the value letsencrypt.org for your GitHub Pages site to be accessible over HTTPS. For more information, see \"Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA)\" in the Let's Encrypt documentation.  Custom domains configured with A records If you configured your custom domain using an A record, your A record must point to one of the following IP addresses for HTTPS to work:  185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153  After updating any A record IP addresses, you must remove and re-add your custom domain to the repository you’re using to publish your Pages site to trigger the process of enabling HTTPS. For more information, see \"Configuring A records with your DNS provider\" in \"Setting up an apex domain.\"   URL formatting error on Linux  Warning: If the URL for your GitHub Pages site contains a username or organization name that begins or ends in a dash, or contains consecutive dashes, then people browsing with Linux will receive a server error when they visit the site. To fix this, change your GitHub username to remove non-alphanumeric characters. For instructions on how to do this, see \"Changing your GitHub username.\" ",

Updating your GitHub access credentials  GitHub credentials include not only your password, but also the access tokens, SSH keys, and application API tokens you use to communicate with GitHub. Should you have the need, you can reset all of these access credentials yourself.  Creating a personal access token for the command line  You can create a personal access token and use it in place of a password when performing Git operations over HTTPS with Git on the command line or the API.  Reviewing your SSH keys  To keep your credentials secure, you should regularly audit your SSH keys, deploy keys, and review authorized applications that access your GitHub account.  Reviewing your deploy keys  You should review deploy keys to ensure that there aren't any unauthorized (or possibly compromised) keys. You can also approve existing deploy keys that are valid.  Authorizing OAuth Apps  You can connect your GitHub identity to third-party applications using OAuth. When authorizing an OAuth App, you should ensure you trust the application, review who it's developed by, and review the kinds of information the application wants to access.  Reviewing your authorized integrations  You can review your authorized integrations to audit the access that each integration has to your account and data.  Connecting with third-party applications  You can connect your GitHub identity to third-party applications using OAuth. When authorizing one of these applications, you should ensure you trust the application, review who it's developed by, and review the kinds of information the application wants to access.  Reviewing your authorized applications (OAuth)  You should review your authorized applications to verify that no new applications with expansive permissions are authorized, such as those that have access to your private repositories.  Reviewing your security log  You can review your account's security log to better understand the actions you've performed in the last 90 days.  Removing sensitive data from a repository  If you commit sensitive data, such as a password or SSH key into a Git repository, you can remove it from the history. To entirely remove unwanted files from a repository's history you can use either the git filter-branch command or the BFG Repo-Cleaner open source tool.  About anonymized image URLs  If you upload an image to GitHub, the URL of the image will be modified so your information is not trackable.  About GitHub's IP addresses  GitHub serves applications from multiple IP address ranges, which are available using the API.  GitHub's SSH key fingerprints  Public key fingerprints can be used to validate a connection to a remote server.  Sudo mode  GitHub asks you for your password before you can modify your email address, authorize third-party applications, or add new public keys, or initiate other sudo-protected actions.  Preventing unauthorized access  You may be alerted to a security incident in the media, such as the discovery of the Heartbleed bug, or your computer could be stolen while you're signed in to GitHub. In such cases, changing your password prevents any unintended future access to your account and projects.",

For more information, see \"About searching on GitHub.\"  Tips:  For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see \"Understanding the search syntax\". Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.  You can focus your cursor on the search bar above the issue or pull request list with a keyboard shortcut. For more information, see \"Using keyboard shortcuts.\"     In this article:  Search only issues or pull requests Search by the title, body, or comments Search within a user's or organization's repositories Search by open or closed state Search by public or private repository Search by author Search by assignee Search by mention Search by team mention Search by commenter Search by a user that's involved in an issue or pull request Search by label Search by milestone Search by project board Search by commit status Search by commit SHA Search by branch name Search by language Search by number of comments Search by pull request review status Search by when an issue or pull request was created or last updated Search by when an issue or pull request was closed Search by when a pull request was merged Search based on whether a pull request is merged or unmerged Search based on whether a repository is archived Search by missing metadata   Search only issues or pull requests By default, GitHub search will return both issues and pull requests. However, you can restrict search results to just issues or pull requests using the type or is qualifier.    Qualifier Example     type:pr  cat type:pr matches pull requests with the word \"cat.\"   type:issue  github commenter:defunkt type:issue matches issues that contain the word \"github,\" and have a comment by @defunkt.   is:pr  event is:pr matches pull requests with the word \"event.\"   is:issue  is:issue label:bug is:closed matches closed issues with the label \"bug.\"     Search by the title, body, or comments With the in qualifier you can restrict your search to the title, body, comments, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, the title, body, and comments are all searched.    Qualifier Example     in:title  warning in:title matches issues with \"warning\" in their title.   in:body  error in:title,body matches issues with \"error\" in their title or body.   in:comments  shipit in:comments matches issues mentioning \"shipit\" in their comments.     Search within a user's or organization's repositories To search issues and pull requests in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the user or org qualifier. To search issues and pull requests in a specific repository, you can use the repo qualifier.    Qualifier Example     user:USERNAME  user:defunkt ubuntu matches issues with the word \"ubuntu\" from repositories owned by @defunkt.   org:ORGNAME  org:github matches issues in repositories owned by the GitHub organization.   repo:USERNAME/REPOSITORY  repo:mozilla/shumway created:&lt;2012-03-01 matches issues from @mozilla's shumway project that were created before March 2012.     Search by open or closed state You can filter issues and pull requests based on whether they're open or closed using the state or is qualifier.    Qualifier Example     state:open  libraries state:open mentions:vmg matches open issues that mention @vmg with the word \"libraries.\"   state:closed  design state:closed in:body matches closed issues with the word \"design\" in the body.   is:open  performance is:open is:issue matches open issues with the word \"performance.\"   is:closed  android is:closed matches closed issues and pull requests with the word \"android.\"     Search by public or private repository If you're searching across all of GitHub, it can be helpful to filter your results based on whether the repository is public or private. You can do this with is:public and is:private.    Qualifier Example     is:public  is:public matches issues and pull requests in all public repositories.   is:private  is:private cupcake matches issues and pull requests that contain the word \"cupcake\" in private repositories you have access to.     Search by author The author qualifier finds issues and pull requests created by a certain user or integration account.    Qualifier Example     author:USERNAME  cool author:gjtorikian matches issues and pull requests with the word \"cool\" that were created by @gjtorikian.     bootstrap in:body author:mdo matches issues written by @mdo that contain the word \"bootstrap\" in the body.   author:app/USERNAME  author:app/robot matches issues created by the integration account named \"robot.\"     Search by assignee The assignee qualifier finds issues and pull requests that are assigned to a certain user. You cannot search for issues and pull requests that have any assignee, however, you can search for issues and pull requests that have no assignee.    Qualifier Example     assignee:USERNAME  assignee:vmg repo:libgit2/libgit2 matches issues and pull requests in libgit2's project libgit2 that are assigned to @vmg.     Search by mention The mentions qualifier finds issues that mention a certain user. For more information, see \"Mentioning people and teams.\"    Qualifier Example     mentions:USERNAME  resque mentions:defunkt matches issues with the word \"resque\" that mention @defunkt.     Search by team mention For organizations and teams you belong to, you can use the team qualifier to find issues or pull requests that @mention a certain team within that organization. Replace these sample names with your organization and team name to perform a search.    Qualifier Example     team:ORGNAME/TEAMNAME  team:jekyll/owners matches issues where the @jekyll/owners team is mentioned.     team:myorg/ops is:open is:pr matches open pull requests where the @myorg/ops team is mentioned.     Search by commenter The commenter qualifier finds issues that contain a comment from a certain user.    Qualifier Example     commenter:USERNAME  github commenter:defunkt org:github matches issues in repositories owned by GitHub, that contain the word \"github,\" and have a comment by @defunkt.     Search by a user that's involved in an issue or pull request You can use the involves qualifier to find issues that in some way involve a certain user. The involves qualifier is a logical OR between the author, assignee, mentions, and commenter qualifiers for a single user. In other words, this qualifier finds issues and pull requests that were either created by a certain user, assigned to that user, mention that user, or were commented on by that user.    Qualifier Example     involves:USERNAME  involves:defunkt involves:jlord matches issues either @defunkt or @jlord are involved in.     NOT bootstrap in:body involves:mdo matches issues @mdo is involved in that do not contain the word \"bootstrap\" in the body.     Search by label You can narrow your results by labels, using the label qualifier. Since issues can have multiple labels, you can list a separate qualifier for each issue.    Qualifier Example     label:LABEL  label:\"help wanted\" language:ruby matches issues with the label \"help wanted\" that are in Ruby repositories.     broken in:body -label:bug label:priority matches issues with the word \"broken\" in the body, that lack the label \"bug\", but do have the label \"priority.\"     label:bug label:resolved matches issues with the labels \"bug\" and \"resolved.\"     Search by milestone The milestone qualifier finds issues or pull requests that are a part of a milestone within a repository.    Qualifier Example     milestone:MILESTONE  milestone:\"overhaul\" matches issues that are in a milestone named \"overhaul.\"     milestone:\"bug fix\" matches issues that are in a milestone named \"bug fix.\"     Search by project board You can use the project qualifier to find issues that are associated with a specific project board in a repository or organization. You must search project boards by the project board number. You can find the project board number at the end of a project board's URL.    Qualifier Example     project:PROJECT_BOARD  project:github/57 matches issues owned by GitHub that are associated with the organization's project board 57.   project:REPOSITORY/PROJECT_BOARD  project:github/linguist/1 matches issues that are associated with project board 1 in @github's linguist repository.     Search by commit status You can filter pull requests based on the status of the commits. This is especially useful if you are using the Status API or a CI service.    Qualifier Example     status:pending  language:go status:pending matches pull requests opened into Go repositories where the status is pending.   status:success  is:open status:success finally in:body matches open pull requests with the word \"finally\" in the body with a successful status.   status:failure  created:2015-05-01..2015-05-30 status:failure matches pull requests opened on May 2015 with a failed status.     Search by commit SHA If you know the specific SHA hash of a commit, you can use it to search for pull requests that contain that SHA. The SHA syntax must be at least seven characters.    Qualifier Example     SHA  e1109ab matches pull requests with a commit SHA that starts with e1109ab.     0eff326d6213c is:merged matches merged pull requests with a commit SHA that starts with 0eff326d6213c.     Search by branch name You can filter pull requests based on the branch they came from (the \"head\" branch) or the branch they are merging into (the \"base\" branch).    Qualifier Example     head:HEAD_BRANCH  head:change is:closed is:unmerged matches pull requests opened from branch names containing the word \"change\" that are closed.   base:BASE_BRANCH  base:gh-pages matches pull requests that are being merged into the gh-pages branch.     Search by language With the language qualifier you can search for issues and pull requests within repositories that are written in a certain language.    Qualifier Example     language:LANGUAGE  language:ruby state:open matches open issues that are in Ruby repositories.     Search by number of comments You can use the comments qualifier along with greater than, less than, and range qualifiers to search by the number of comments.    Qualifier Example     comments:n  state:closed comments:&gt;100 matches closed issues with more than 100 comments.     comments:500..1000 matches issues with comments ranging from 500 to 1,000.     Search by pull request review status You can filter pull requests based on their review status (none, required, approved, changes requested, or required), by reviewer, and by requested reviewer.    Qualifier Example     review:none  type:pr review:none matches pull requests that have not been reviewed.   review:required  type:pr review:required matches pull requests that require a review before they can be merged.   review:approved  type:pr review:approved matches pull requests that a reviewer has approved.   review:changes_requested  type:pr review:changes_requested matches pull requests in which a reviewer has asked for changes.   reviewed-by:USERNAME  type:pr reviewed-by:gjtorikian matches pull requests reviewed by a particular person.   review-requested:USERNAME  type:pr review-requested:benbalter matches pull requests where a specific person is requested for review. Requested reviewers are no longer listed in the search results after they review a pull request. If the requested person is on a team that is requested for review, then review requests for that team will also appear in the search results.   team-review-requested:TEAMNAME  type:pr review-requested:atom/design matches pull requests that have review requests from the team atom/design. Requested reviewers are no longer listed in the search results after they review a pull request.     Search by when an issue or pull request was created or last updated You can filter issues based on times of creation, or when they were last updated. For issue creation, you can use the created qualifier; to find out when an issue was last updated, you'll want to use the updated qualifier. Both take a date as a parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).  Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     created:YYYY-MM-DD  language:c# created:&lt;2011-01-01 state:open matches open issues that were created before 2011 in repositories written in C#.   updated:YYYY-MM-DD  weird in:body updated:&gt;=2013-02-01 matches issues with the word \"weird\" in the body that were updated after February 2013.     Search by when an issue or pull request was closed You can filter issues and pull requests based on when they were closed, using the closed qualifier. This qualifier takes a date as its parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).  Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     closed:YYYY-MM-DD  language:swift closed:&gt;2014-06-11 matches issues and pull requests in Swift that were closed after June 11, 2014.     data in:body closed:&lt;2012-10-01 matches issues and pull requests with the word \"data\" in the body that were closed before October 2012.     Search by when a pull request was merged You can filter pull requests based on when they were merged, using the merged qualifier. This qualifier takes a date as its parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).  Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     merged:YYYY-MM-DD  language:javascript merged:&lt;2011-01-01 matches pull requests in JavaScript repositories that were merged before 2011.     fast in:title language:ruby merged:&gt;=2014-05-01 matches pull requests in Ruby with the word \"fast\" in the title that were merged after May 2014.     Search based on whether a pull request is merged or unmerged You can filter pull requests based on whether they're merged or unmerged using the is qualifier.    Qualifier Example     is:merged  bugfix is:pr is:merged matches merged pull requests with the word \"bugfix.\"   is:unmerged  error is:unmerged matches closed issues and pull requests with the word \"error.\"     Search based on whether a repository is archived The archived qualifier filters your results based on whether an issue or pull request is in an archived repository.    Qualifier Example     archived:true  archived:true GNOME matches issues and pull requests that contain the word \"GNOME\" in archived repositories you have access to.   archived:false  archived:false GNOME matches issues and pull requests that contain the word \"GNOME\" in unarchived repositories you have access to.     Search by missing metadata You can narrow your search to issues and pull requests that are missing certain metadata, using the no qualifier. That metadata includes:  Labels Milestones Assignees Projects     Qualifier Example     no:label  priority no:label matches issues and pull requests with the word \"priority\" that also don't have any labels.   no:milestone  sprint no:milestone type:issue matches issues not associated with a milestone containing the word \"sprint.\"   no:assignee  important no:assignee language:java type:issue matches issues not associated with an assignee, containing the word \"important,\" and in Java repositories.   no:project  build no:project matches issues not associated with a project board, containing the word \"build.\"     Further reading  \"Sorting search results\" ",

Recovering your SSH key passphrase  If you've lost your SSH key passphrase, depending on the operating system you use, you may either recover it or you may need to generate a new SSH key passphrase.  Deleted or missing SSH keys  As a security precaution, GitHub automatically deletes SSH keys that haven't been used in a year.

If the bandwidth and storage quotas are not enough, you can choose to purchase an additional quota for Git LFS. Unused bandwidth doesn't roll over month-to-month. Bandwidth and storage usage only count against the repository owner's quotas. In forks, bandwidth and storage usage count against the root of the repository network. Anyone with write access to a repository can push files to Git LFS without affecting their personal bandwidth and storage quotas or purchasing data packs. Forking and pulling a repository counts against the parent repository's bandwidth limit.  Purchasing additional storage and bandwidth Additional storage and bandwidth is offered in a single data pack. One data pack costs $5 per month, and provides a monthly quota of 50 GB for bandwidth and 50 GB for storage. You can purchase as many data packs as you need. For example, if you need 150 GB of storage, you'd buy three data packs. Purchasing data packs for Git LFS is independent of any other paid feature or product on GitHub.

      "category": "Setup",
      "category_url": "/categories/setup",
      "url": "/articles/dealing-with-line-endings",
      "body": " If you're using Git to collaborate with others on GitHub, ensure that Git is properly configured to handle line endings.  Every time you press return on your keyboard you're actually inserting an invisible character called a line ending. Historically, different operating systems have handled line endings differently. When you view changes in a file, Git handles line endings in its own way. Since you're collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub, Git might produce unexpected results if, for example, you're working on a Windows machine, and your collaborator has made a change in OS X.  Global settings for line endings The git config core.autocrlf command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument.  On OS X, you simply pass input to the configuration. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf input # Configure Git on OS X to properly handle line endings    On Windows, you simply pass true to the configuration. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf true # Configure Git on Windows to properly handle line endings    On Linux, you simply pass input to the configuration. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf input # Configure Git on Linux to properly handle line endings    On OS X and Linux, you usually want to pass input for this setting. On Windows, you usually want to use true. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf input # Configure Git on OS X or Linux to properly handle line endings git config --global core.autocrlf true # Configure Git on Windows to properly handle line endings    Per-repository settings Optionally, you can configure the way Git manages line endings on a per-repository basis by configuring a special .gitattributes file. This file is committed into the repository and overrides an individual's core.autocrlf setting, ensuring consistent behavior for all users, regardless of their Git settings. The advantage of a .gitattributes file is that your line configurations are associated with your repository. You don't need to worry about whether or not collaborators have the same line ending settings that you do. The .gitattributes file must be created in the root of the repository and committed like any other file. A .gitattributes file looks like a table with two columns:  On the left is the file name for Git to match. On the right is the line ending configuration that Git should use for those files.   Example Here's an example .gitattributes file. You can use it as a template for your repositories: # Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set. * text=auto # Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted # to native line endings on checkout. *.c text *.h text # Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout. *.sln text eol=crlf # Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified. *.png binary *.jpg binary  You'll notice that files are matched--*.c, *.sln, *.png--, separated by a space, then given a setting--text, text eol=crlf, binary. We'll go over some possible settings below.  text=auto Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best. This is a good default option.  text eol=crlf Git will always convert line endings to CRLF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep CRLF endings, even on OSX or Linux.   text eol=lf Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows.  binary Git will understand that the files specified are not text, and it should not try to change them. The binary setting is also an alias for -text -diff.  Refreshing a repository after changing line endings After you've set the core.autocrlf option and committed a .gitattributes file, you may find that Git wants to commit files that you have not modified. At this point, Git is eager to change the line endings of every file for you. The best way to automatically configure your repository's line endings is to first backup your files with Git, delete every file in your repository (except the .git directory), and then restore the files all at once.   Save your current files in Git, so that none of your work is lost.  git add . -u git commit -m \"Saving files before refreshing line endings\"    Remove the index and force Git to rescan the working directory.  rm .git/index    Rewrite the Git index to pick up all the new line endings.  git reset    Show the rewritten, normalized files.  git status    Add all your changed files back, and prepare them for a commit. This is your chance to inspect which files, if any, were unchanged.  git add -u # It is perfectly safe to see a lot of messages here that read # \"warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in file.\"    Rewrite the .gitattributes file.  git add .gitattributes    Commit the changes to your repository.  git commit -m \"Normalize all the line endings\"     Further reading  \"Customizing Git - Git Attributes\" from the Pro Git book \"git-config(1) Manual Page\" \"Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup\" from the Pro Git book \"Mind the End of Your Line\" - The full story of line endings in Git by Tim Clem   ",

Viewing differences You can visually compare images in three different modes: 2-up, swipe, and onion skin.  2-up 2-up is the default mode; it gives you a quick glimpse of both images. In addition, if the image has changed size between versions, the actual dimension change is displayed. This should make it very apparent when things are resized, such as when assets are upgraded to higher resolutions.   Swipe Swipe lets you view portions of your image side by side. Not sure if colors shifted between different versions? Drag the swipe slider over the area in question and compare the pixels for yourself.   Onion skin Onion Skin really comes in handy when elements move around by small, hard to notice amounts. Did an icon shift two pixels to the left?

Scope of support If your support request is outside of the scope of what our team can help you with, we may recommend next steps to resolve your issue outside of GitHub Support. Your support request is possibly out of GitHub Support's scope if it's primarily about:  Third party integrations Hardware setup CI/CD, such as Jenkins Writing scripts Configuration of external authentication systems, such as SAML identity providers Open Source projects  If you're uncertain if the issue is out of scope, open a ticket and we're happy to help you determine the best way to proceed.  Contacting GitHub Premium Support GitHub Premium Support customers can use the Premium Support portal to report incidents in writing. You can also receive English-language support over the phone. For the GitHub Premium Support phone number, see \"24x7 Phone Support\" in the Premium Support portal.  Hours of operation GitHub Premium Support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.  Service Level Agreement response times For tickets you submit, support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. The initial response time guaranteed by the SLA is dependent on the severity level of the incident. Response time begins when GitHub Premium Support sets the severity level of the incident ticket. A response does not mean the issue has been resolved.    Incident severity level Initial response time     Urgent 30 minutes   High 4 hours     Assigning a severity level to an incident GitHub Support sets the severity level of incident tickets and has the sole discretion to modify the severity level. Incident tickets can have one of four severity levels: Urgent, High, Moderate, or Low.    Severity level Description     Urgent This severity level is the highest priority and receives first attention. Urgent severity tickets include critical system failure.   High This severity level indicates incidents that impact business operations. High severity tickets are requests such as removing sensitive data (commits, issues, pull requests, uploaded attachments) from your own accounts and organization restoration.   Moderate This severity level indicates technical requests including bug reports for non-critical parts of the product, general 2FA, account recovery, user flagged as spam or user login issues.   Low This severity level indicates non-technical requests. Low severity tickets include:  General how-to questions and feature requests Help with wikis, GitHub Pages, GitHub Desktop, and Atom  Excessive resource usage Purchase requests Training requests Health checks       Resolving and closing issues For issues that can be solved, GitHub Premium Support may provide a resolution in the form of an explanation, recommendation, usage instructions, workaround instructions, or by advising you of an available release that addresses the issue. If you use a custom or unsupported plug-in, module, or custom code, GitHub Premium Support may ask you to remove the unsupported plug-in, module, or code while attempting to resolve the issue. If the problem is fixed when the unsupported plug-in, module, or custom code is removed, GitHub Premium Support may consider the issue resolved. GitHub Premium Support may close issues if they're outside the scope of support or if multiple attempts to contact you have gone unanswered. If an incident is closed due to lack of response, you can request that it be reopened.  Receiving credits for missed ticket responses If you don't receive an initial response within the guaranteed response time to more than four incidents in a given quarter based on GitHub's fiscal year, you're eligible for a credit. To honor the SLA, GitHub will refund 20% of the quarterly GitHub Premium Support fee in cash. To receive the refund, you must submit a credit request. The credit request must be made within 30 days of the end of the quarter during which the incident tickets were not responded to within the designated response time.

Tracking storage and bandwidth use When you commit and push a change to a file tracked with Git LFS, a new version of the entire file is pushed and the total file size is counted against the repository owner's storage limit. When you download a file tracked with Git LFS, the total file size is counted against the repository owner's bandwidth limit. Git LFS uploads do not count against the bandwidth limit. For example:  If you push a 500 MB file to Git LFS, you'll use 500 MB of your allotted storage and none of your bandwidth. If you make a 1 byte change and push the file again, you'll use another 500 MB of storage and no bandwidth, bringing your total usage for these two pushes to 1 GB of storage and zero bandwidth. If you download a 500 MB file that's tracked with LFS, you'll use 500 MB of the repository owner's allotted bandwidth. If a collaborator pushes a change to the file and you pull the new version to your local repository, you'll use another 500 MB of bandwidth, bringing the total usage for these two downloads to 1 GB of bandwidth.

Enabling protected branches also allows you to enable other optional checks and requirements, like required status checks and required reviews.  Configuring protected branches  If you're a repository owner or have admin permissions in a repository, you can customize branch protections in the repository and enforce certain workflows, such as requiring more than one pull request review or requiring certain status checks to pass before allowing a pull request to merge.  About required status checks  Required status checks ensure that all required CI tests are passing before collaborators can make changes to a protected branch.  Types of required status checks  You can set up required status checks to either be \"loose\" or \"strict.\" The type of required status check you choose determines whether your branch is required to be up to date with the base branch before merging.  Enabling required status checks  Repository administrators can enforce required status checks before a branch is merged in a pull request or before commits on a local branch can be pushed to the protected remote branch.

Follow your DNS provider's instructions to create a CNAME record that points your subdomain to your default pages domain. For example, if you own the subdomain www.example.com, you can configure a CNAME record to point www.example.com to YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io.

      "body": "You can configure pull request merge options on GitHub to meet your workflow needs and preferences for managing Git history. You can enforce one type of merge method, such as commit squashing or rebasing, by only enabling the desired method for your repository. When you click the default Merge pull request option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit. The pull request is merged using the --no-ff option. To merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository.   Squashing your merge commits When you select the Squash and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch. Pull requests with squashed commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To squash and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow squash merging.  You can use squash and merge to create a more streamlined Git history in your repository. Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they aren’t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit while merging to the default branch, you can retain the original changes with a clear Git history. Before enabling squashing commits, consider these disadvantages:  You lose information about when specific changes were originally made and who authored the squashed commits. Some Git commands that use the \"SHA\" or \"hash\" ID may be harder to use since the SHA ID for the original commits is lost. For example, using git rerere may not be as effective.  For more information, see \"Configuring commit squashing for pull requests.\"  Rebasing and merging your commits When you select the Rebase and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit. Pull requests with rebased commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To rebase and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow rebase merging. The rebase and merge behavior on GitHub deviates slightly from git rebase. Rebase and merge on GitHub will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs, whereas git rebase outside of GitHub does not change the committer information when the rebase happens on top of an ancestor commit. For more information about git rebase, see the \"Git rebase\" chapter from the Pro Git book. For a visual representation of git rebase, see The \"Git Branching - Rebasing\" chapter from the Pro Git book. Before enabling commit rebasing, consider these disadvantages:  Repository contributors may have to rebase on the command line, resolve any conflicts, and force push their changes to the pull request's topic branch (or remote head branch) before they can use the rebase and merge option on GitHub. Force pushing must be done carefully so contributors don't overwrite work that others have based their work on. To learn more about when the Rebase and merge option is disabled on GitHub and the workflow to re-enable it, see \"About pull request merges.\"  For more information, see \"Configuring commit rebasing for pull requests.\"",

      "body": " You can define code owners in public repositories with GitHub Free, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see \"GitHub's products.\"  People with admin or owner permissions can set up a CODEOWNERS file in a repository. The people you choose as code owners must have write permissions for the repository. Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews, they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository. For more information, see \"Enabling required reviews for pull requests.\"  CODEOWNERS file location To use a CODEOWNERS file, create a new file called CODEOWNERS in the root, docs/, or .github/ directory of the repository, in the branch where you'd like to add the code owners. Each CODEOWNERS file assigns the code owners for a single branch in the repository. Thus, you can assign different code owners for different branches, such as @octo-org/codeowners-team for a code base on the master branch and @octocat for a GitHub Pages site on the gh-pages branch. For code owners to receive review requests, the CODEOWNERS file must be on the base branch of the pull request. For example, if you assign @octocat as the code owner for .js files on the gh-pages branch of your repository, @octocat will receive review requests when a pull request with changes to .js files is opened between the head branch and gh-pages.  CODEOWNERS syntax A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows the same rules used in gitignore files. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the standard @username or @org/team-name format. You can also refer to a user by an email address that has been added to their GitHub account, for example user@example.com.  Example of a CODEOWNERS file # This is a comment. # Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners. # These owners will be the default owners for everything in # the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, # @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for # review when someone opens a pull request. * @global-owner1 @global-owner2 # Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most # precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only # modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global # owner(s) will be requested for a review. *.js @js-owner # You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be # used to look up users just like we do for commit author # emails. *.go docs@example.com # In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs # directory at the root of the repository and any of its # subdirectories. /build/logs/ @doctocat # The `docs/*` pattern will match files like # `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like # `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`. docs/* docs@example.com # In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory # anywhere in your repository. apps/ @octocat # In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs` # directory in the root of your repository. /docs/ @doctocat   Further reading  \"Creating new files\" \"Inviting collaborators to a personal repository\" \"Managing an individual's access to an organization repository\" \"Managing team access to an organization repository\" \"Viewing a pull request review\" ",

      "body": " A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.  Propose changes to someone else's project A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:  Fork the repository. Make the fix. Submit a pull request to the project owner.  If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!  Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software. When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.  Fork an example repository Forking a repository is a simple two-step process. We've created a repository for you to practice with!  On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.    That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.  Keep your fork synced You might fork a project in order to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same octocat/Spoon-Knife repository you just forked!  Step 1: Set up Git If you haven't yet, you should first set up Git. Don't forget to set up authentication to GitHub from Git as well.  Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository on your computer. Let's create a clone of your fork locally on your computer.  On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.   In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife    Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`... remote: Counting objects: 10, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done. remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1) Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.    Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository!  Step 3: Configure Git to sync your fork with the original Spoon-Knife repository When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or upstream, repository into the local clone of your fork.  On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.   In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned in Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork.  To go to your home directory, type just cd with no other text. To list the files and folders in your current directory, type ls. To go into one of your listed directories, type cd your_listed_directory. To go up one directory, type cd ...    Type git remote -v and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.  git remote -v origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)    Type git remote add upstream, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 and press Enter. It will look like this:  git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git    To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type git remote -v again. You should see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream.  git remote -v origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push) upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)    Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands. For more information, see \"Syncing a fork.\"  Next steps The sky's the limit with the changes you can make to a fork, including:   Creating branches: Branches allow you to build new features or test out ideas without putting your main project at risk.  Opening pull requests: If you are hoping to contribute back to the original repository, you can send a request to the original author to pull your fork into their repository by submitting a pull request.   Find another repository to fork Fork a repository to start contributing to a project. You can fork any public repository, or any private repository you can access. For more information, see \"About forks.\" You can browse Explore to find projects and start contributing to open source repositories.

      "url": "/articles/github-anti-bribery-statement",
      "body": "GitHub upholds our commitment to ethical business practices, including by prohibiting bribery and corruption. As Transparency International explains, the costs of corruption are   political, by posing a major obstacle to democracy and the rule of law  economic, by depleting national wealth  social, by undermining people’s trust in political society, institutions, and leaders  environmental, by facilitating non-enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.  According to the World Bank in 2017, businesses and individuals pay an estimated $1.5 trillion in bribes each year.  GitHub policies prohibiting bribery GitHub makes our anti-bribery commitment clear in a number of company policies. GitHub's Code of Ethics prohibits employees and contractors from engaging in or contributing to bribery or corruption, and establishes record-keeping requirements:  You must never pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, induce, accept, or authorize payment of anything else of value, to anyone—including to anyone in a position of power or authority, such as government officials, or in commercial transactions—in order to obtain or keep business, or secure any other improper advantage for GitHub or Microsoft. You also must not solicit or accept a bribe, kickback, or any other improper cash payment. ... [GitHub employees] are required to keep accurate and fair records of all transactions involving any expense made on GitHub’s behalf—for example, by keeping receipts and providing accurate descriptions of your expenses—or any other transaction involving the disposal or transfer of GitHub assets. Such actions are required by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which GitHub does business and are also simply the right thing to do.  GitHub's Code of Ethics elaborates on certain situations, including gifts, travel, and entertainment; facilitating payments; charitable donations; jobs; and working with representatives, as well as on who is considered a government official. GitHub's Standards of Conduct prohibit:  Bribing government officials or other individuals to gain an unfair advantage, and taking bribes from anyone.  GitHub’s Gifts and Entertainment Policy explains that bribery is not permitted in connection with travel or entertainment, and provides examples to illustrate improper conduct. The policy describes proper and improper gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses; company processes for gift-giving by GitHub’s directors, officers, employees, and agents and requirements for record-keeping, penalties; and reporting of violations. It includes clear monetary thresholds for gifts along with annual limitations, with limited exceptions for gifts approved by appropriate management. The policy is clear and easily accessible to GitHub employees and contractors.  Training for our employees GitHub employees are required to participate in training on corruption, including bribery. We also provide additional training for particularly relevant people and teams, such as our sales team. The training explains relevant elements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. For example,  definition and structural effects of corruption who is covered, including  public officials or others in a position of power third parties   what kind of activity is covered, including  cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment facilitation payments charitable contributions and sponsorship   for what purpose, including  intent improper advantage or influence   due diligence and red flags record-keeping requirements  In addition, the training covers GitHub’s internal policies related to anti-corruption and bribery, including our non-retaliation (whistleblower) policy. While the U.S. FCPA is focused on interactions with government officials, the U.K. Bribery Act is broader and extends to bribing anyone, regardless of whether they are a government official. Both laws can extend to GitHub’s actions elsewhere on the globe. GitHub’s policies prohibit bribing anyone, anywhere in the world.  Engaging our Partners  GitHub’s standard resale agreements with Partners include mandatory anti-corruption clauses. Going forward, GitHub now requires our Channel Partners to commit to complying with this Anti-Corruption Statement. Going forward, GitHub’s vendor contracts now require a commitment to comply with this Anti-Corruption Statement. ",

For more information on apex domains, see \"About supported custom domains.\" To determine which type of DNS record to configure with your DNS provider, check if your DNS provider supports ALIAS or ANAME records. We recommend configuring your apex domain with an ALIAS or ANAME record when possible because they are easier to set up and require less updating since they point your site to another domain name instead of an IP address. A records point your site to one or more IP address and require updating when the IP address changes.  Note: Some DNS providers support configuring apex domains with an ALIAS or ANAME record, but there is no industry standard for these. Only DNS Made Easy currently supports ANAME records and DNSimple is one of the few DNS providers that support ALIAS records.   If your DNS provider does support ALIAS or ANAME records, then see configuring an ALIAS or ANAME record with your DNS provider. If your DNS provider does not support ALIAS or ANAME records, then see configuring A records with your DNS provider   Configuring an ALIAS or ANAME record with your DNS provider  Contact your DNS provider for detailed instructions on how to set up ALIAS or ANAME records.  Follow your DNS provider's instructions to create an ALIAS or ANAME record that points your apex domain to the GitHub Pages server at your default pages domain. Your DNS changes can take over a full day to update and the wait varies among DNS providers.  Note: Your default GitHub Pages domain is determined by the type of pages site you have. For examples, see this domain chart.    To confirm that your DNS record is set up correctly, use the dig command with your custom domain. Using a custom domain as an example:  dig example.com +noall +answer example.com. 3600 IN A 199.27.XX.XXX  When you use the dig command with your GitHub Pages default domain, your domain should resolve or point to the same IP address. For example:  dig YOUR-USERNAME.github.io +noall +answer YOUR-USERNAME.github.io 3600 IN A 199.27.XX.XXX   Add your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site. If you're updating an existing custom domain, first remove and then re-add your custom domain to your GitHub account to trigger the process of enabling HTTPS. For more information, see \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"   Configuring A records with your DNS provider  Contact your DNS provider for detailed instructions on how to set up A records.  Follow your DNS provider's instructions to create A records that point your custom domain to the following IP addresses:   185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153   Tip: Your DNS changes can take over a full day to update and the wait varies among DNS providers.    To confirm that your DNS record is set up correctly, use the dig command with your custom domain. Using a custom domain as an example:  dig +noall +answer example.com ;example.com. example.com. 3600 IN A 185.199.108.153 example.com. 3600 IN A 185.199.109.153 example.com. 3600 IN A 185.199.110.153 example.com. 3600 IN A 185.199.111.153  Your apex domain should point to the IP addresses you configured.  Add your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site. If you're updating the IP address of an existing A record, first remove and then re-add your custom domain to the repository you’re using to publish your Pages site to trigger the process of enabling HTTPS. For more information, see \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"   Further reading  \"Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages\" \"Troubleshooting custom domains\" \"Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS\" ",

      "category": "Site Policy",
      "category_url": "/categories/site-policy",
      "url": "/articles/github-sensitive-data-removal-policy",
      "body": "If you believe that content on GitHub infringes a valid copyright you own, please see our DMCA Takedown Policy and our Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice. We rely on the DMCA notice and takedown process for the majority of our removal actions. However, we understand that sensitive, security-related content may get published on GitHub – whether accidentally or on purpose – from time to time. We provide our sensitive data removal process to remove this sensitive data in certain exceptional circumstances where the DMCA process would not be applicable, such as when your security is at risk from exposed passwords and you do not own the copyright to the specific content that you need removed, or the content is not protectable by copyright. This guide describes the information GitHub needs from you in order to process a request to remove sensitive data from a repository.  What is Sensitive Data? For the purposes of this document, “sensitive data” refers to content that (i) should have been kept confidential, and (ii) whose public availability poses a specific or targeted security risk to you or your organization.  Sensitive data removal requests are appropriate for:  Access credentials, such as user names combined with passwords, access tokens, or other sensitive secrets that can grant access to your organization's server, network, or domain. AWS tokens and other similar access credentials that grant access to a third party on your behalf. You must be able to show that the token does belong to you. Documentation (such as network diagrams) that poses a specific security risk for an organization. Internal server names, IP addresses, and URLs, on their own, are not sufficiently sensitive; you must be able to show that the internal server name's use in a particular file or piece of code poses a security threat.   Sensitive data removal requests are not appropriate for:   Requests to remove content that may infringe your or your organization's copyright rights. If you have questions about how GitHub handles copyright-related matters or would like to report potentially infringing content, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy. The sensitive data removal process is generally not intended for the removal of full files or repositories — only for the specific pieces of sensitive data in those files. While there may be cases where files are filled entirely with sensitive information, you must justify the security risk for the removal of such files, and this may increase the time required to process your request. Trademark disputes. If you have questions about how GitHub handles trademark-related matters or would like to report content containing your organization's trade or service marks, please review our Trademark Policy. Mere mentions of your company's identity, name, brand, domain name, or other references to your company in files on GitHub. You must be able to articulate why a use of your company's identity is a threat to your company's security posture before we will take action under this policy. Privacy complaints. If you have concerns about your own privacy or you are contacting us on behalf of your employees due to a privacy concern — for example, if there are private email addresses or other personal information posted — please contact us via our Privacy contact form. Entire files or repositories that do not pose a specific security risk, but you believe are otherwise objectionable.  Content governed by our Community Guidelines, such as malware or general-purpose tools. If you have questions about our Community Guidelines or believe that content on GitHub might violate our guidelines, you can report that content here.   Things to Know Ask Nicely First. A great first step before sending us a request to remove data is to try contacting the user directly. They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README or Support file, or you could get in touch by creating an issue or pull request in the repository. This is not strictly required, but it is appreciated. No Bots. You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every request you send. If you're outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints often include data that does not pose any security threats, and they do not include sufficient explanations, requiring additional back-and-forth and resulting in delays, even when the complaint is valid. Send In The Correct Request. We offer this sensitive data removal process as an exceptional service only for high-risk content. We are not able to use this process to remove other kinds of content, such as potentially infringing content, and we are not able to process any other kinds of removal requests simultaneously while processing sensitive removal requests. We will be able to help you more quickly if you send in your sensitive data removal requests separately from any requests to remove potentially infringing content. If you are unsure whether your request involves only sensitive data or also involves other legal matters, please consult legal counsel. Processing Time. While we do process sensitive data removal requests as quickly as possible, due to the volume of requests we process, it may take some time for your request to be reviewed. Additional requests, or multiple requests from additional points of contact, may result in delays.  How Does This Actually Work?  Complainant Investigates. It is up to the requesting party to conduct their own investigation and to provide us with the details we require — most importantly, an explanation of how the data poses a security risk. GitHub is not in a position to search for or make initial determinations about sensitive data on any individual's or organization's behalf. Complainant Sends a Sensitive Data Removal Request. After conducting an investigation, the complainant prepares and sends a sensitive data removal request to GitHub. If the request is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate the security risk and for GitHub to locate the data, we will reply and ask for more information. GitHub Asks User to Make Changes. In most cases, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them an opportunity to delete or modify the sensitive data specified in the request or to dispute the claim.  User Notifies GitHub of Changes. If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the window of time they've been allowed. If they don't, we will disable the repository. If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and notify the complainant.  OR  User May Dispute the Request. If a user believes the the content in question is not sensitive data subject to this Policy, they may dispute it. If they do, we will generally leave it up to the complainant to contact the user and work things out with them directly, within reason. Complainant Reviews Changes. If the user makes changes, the complainant must review them. If the changes are insufficient, the complainant must provide GitHub with details explaining why. GitHub may disable the repository or give the user an additional chance to make the changes. User May Request an Additional Window to Make Changes. If the user missed their opportunity to remove the sensitive data specified in the notice, we may allow them an additional 24-hour window, upon request, to make those changes. In that event, GitHub will notify the complainant.   What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?) One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to \"fork\" one another's repositories. What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories. As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project. Each of these copies is a \"fork\" of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the \"parent\" of the fork. GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. This is because forks belong to different users and may have been altered in significant ways. GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks. We expect those sending sensitive data removal requests to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks also contain sensitive data, expressly include forks in their request.  Sending A Sensitive Data Removal Request Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible. In order for us to verify that a user has removed reported sensitive data completely, we need to know exactly where to look. These guidelines are designed to make the processing of requests to remove sensitive data as straightforward as possible.  Your Request Must Include:  A working, clickable link to each file containing sensitive data. (Note that we're not able to work from search results, examples, or screenshots.) Specific line numbers within each file containing the sensitive data. A brief description of how each item you've identified poses a security risk to you or your organization. It is important that you provide an explanation of how the data poses a security risk beyond merely stating that it does.  If you are a third party acting as an agent for an organization facing a security risk, include a statement that you have a legal right to act on behalf of that organization. OPTIONAL: Let us know if your request is particularly urgent, and why. We respond to all sensitive data removal requests as quickly as possible. However, if this request is especially time-sensitive, such as a very recent credential exposure, please explain why.   How to Submit Your Request You can email your request to remove sensitive data to support@github.com or submit your request via our Contact form. Please include a plain-text version of your request in the body of your message. Sending your request in an attachment may result in processing delays.  Disputes If you received a sensitive data removal request from us, you can dispute it by replying to our email and letting us know — in as much detail as possible — why you think the content in question is not sensitive data subject to this Policy.

      "body": "You can search for users globally across all of GitHub. For more information, see \"About searching on GitHub.\"  Tips:  For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see \"Understanding the search syntax\". Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    In this article:  Search only users or organizations Search by username, full name, or public email Search by number of repositories a user owns Search by location Search by repository language Search by when a user account was created Search by number of followers   Search only users or organizations By default, searching users will return both personal and organizations. However, you can use the type qualifier to restrict search results to personal accounts or organizations only.    Qualifier Example     type:user  mike in:name created:&lt;2011-01-01 type:user matches personal accounts named \"mike\" that were created before 2011.   type:org  data in:email type:org matches organizations with the word \"data\" in their email.     Search by username, full name, or public email With the in qualifier you can restrict your search to the username (login), full name, public email, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, only the username and email address are searched. For privacy reasons, you cannot search by email domain name.    Qualifier Example     in:login  kenya in:login matches users with the word \"kenya\" in their username.   in:fullname  bolton in:fullname matches users whose real name contains the word \"bolton.\"   in:email  data in:email matches users with the word \"data\" in their email.     Search by number of repositories a user owns You can filter users based on the number of repositories they own, using the repos qualifier and greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     repos:n  repos:&gt;9000 matches users whose repository count is over 9,000.     bert repos:10..30 matches users with the word \"bert\" in their username or real name who own 10 to 30 repositories.     Search by location You can search for users by the location indicated in their profile.    Qualifier Example     location:LOCATION  repos:1 location:iceland matches users with exactly one repository that live in Iceland.     Search by repository language Using the language qualifier you can search for users based on the languages of repositories they own.    Qualifier Example     language:LANGUAGE  language:javascript location:russia matches users in Russia with a majority of their repositories written in JavaScript.     jenny language:javascript in:fullname matches users with JavaScript repositories whose full name contains the word \"jenny.\"     Search by when a user account was created You can filter users based on when they joined GitHub with the created qualifier. This takes a date as its parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).  Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     created:YYYY-MM-DD  created:&lt;2011-01-01 matches users that joined before 2011.     created:&gt;=2013-05-11 matches users that joined at or after May 11th, 2013.     created:2013-03-06 location:london matches users that joined on March 6th, 2013, who list their location as London.     created:2010-01-01..2011-01-01 john in:login matches users that joined between 2010 and 2011 with the word \"john\" in their username.     Search by number of followers You can filter users based on the number of followers that they have, using the followers qualifier with greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     followers:n  followers:&gt;=1000 matches users with 1,000 or more followers.     sparkle followers:1..10 matches users with between 1 and 10 followers, with the word \"sparkle\" in their name.

For more information, see \"GitHub's products.\"  With SAML SSO, organization administrators can invite members to connect their existing GitHub user accounts to a supported IdP. SAML SSO gives organizations a centralized and secure way of controlling access to their resources on GitHub and helps organization members maintain control of their identity and contributions. Organization members sign in through the organization's IdP, and their existing GitHub account is linked to an external identity that belongs to the organization. This external identity is separate from, but related to, their GitHub account and is used to control access to the organization's resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests.  Note: Outside collaborators aren't required to have an external (SAML) identity to access an organization that uses SAML SSO.  Organization members must periodically log in to the SAML provider to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires users to re-identify themselves to continue. To access the organization's protected resources using the API and Git on the command line, members will be required to create and use personal access tokens. Organization administrators can revoke the access token at any time. For more information, see \"Viewing and revoking organization members' authorized access to tokens.\" SAML SSO can be disabled, enabled but not enforced, or enabled and enforced. For more information on setting up and enforcing SAML SSO for your GitHub organization, see \"Connecting your identity provider to your organization\" and \"Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization.\"  Supported SAML services We offer limited support for all identity providers that implement the SAML 2.0 standard. We officially support these identity providers that have been internally tested:  Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Okta OneLogin PingOne Shibboleth  If your IdP supports SCIM, members are automatically invited to join the GitHub organization when access is provisioned in your IdP and will be automatically removed from the GitHub organization when their access is removed from your IdP. GitHub does not support SAML Single Logout. To terminate an active SAML session, users should log out directly on your SAML server.

If your commits are being linked to another user, or not linked to a user at all, you may need to change your local Git configuration settings, add an email address to your account email settings, or do both.   Note: If your commits are linked to another user, that does not mean the user can access your repository. A user can only access a repository you own if you add them as a collaborator or add them to a team that has access to the repository.   Commits are linked to another user If your commits are linked to another user, that means the user has added the email address in your local Git configuration settings to their GitHub account. In this case, you can change the email in your local Git configuration settings and add the new email address to your GitHub account to link future commits to your account.  To change the email address in your local Git configuration, follow the steps in \"Setting your commit email address in Git\". If you work on multiple machines, you will need to change this setting on each one. Add the email address from step 2 to your account settings by following the steps in \"Adding an email address to your GitHub account\".  Commits you make from this point forward will be linked to your account.  Commits are not linked to any user If your commits are not linked to any user, we will display the grey Octocat logo beside them:  To check the email address used for those commits and connect commits to your account, take the following steps:  Navigate to the commit by clicking the commit message link.   To read a message about why the commit is not linked, hover over the blue  to the right of the username.    Unrecognized author (with email address) If you see this message with an email address, it means the address has not been added to your account settings. To link your commits, add the email address to your GitHub email settings.  Unrecognized author (no email address) If you see this message without an email address, it means you used a generic email address that can't be added to your email settings. You will need to set your commit email address in Git, then add the new address to your GitHub email settings to link your future commits. Old commits will not be linked.  Invalid email This means the email address in your local Git configuration settings is either blank or not formatted as an email address. You will need to set your commit email address in Git, then add the new address to your GitHub email settings to link your future commits. Old commits will not be linked.     If your local Git configuration contained a generic email address, or an email address that was already attached to another user's account, then your previous commits will not be linked to your account.

For more information, see \"Configuring protected branches\" and \"Enabling required status checks.\" Required status checks can be checks or statuses. For more information, see \"About status checks.\" After enabling required status checks, all required status checks must pass before branches can be merged into the protected branch. Any commits must either be pushed to another branch and then merged or pushed directly to the protected branch, after all required status checks have passed.  If you have a check and a status with the same name and you select that name as a required status check, both the check and the status will be required. For more information, see \"Checks\" in the GitHub Developer documentation. Once you've set up required status checks, your branch must be up to date with the base branch before merging. This ensures that your branch has been tested with the latest code from the base branch. If your branch is out of date, you'll need to merge the base branch into your branch.   Note: You can also bring your branch up to date with the base branch by using Git rebase.   You won't be able to push local changes to a protected branch until all required status checks pass. Instead, you'll receive an error message similar to the following:  remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/master. remote: error: Required status check \"ci-build\" is failing   Note: Pull requests that are up to date and pass required status checks can be merged locally and pushed to the protected branch. This can be done without status checks running on the merge commit itself.  Administrators of a repository can merge a protected branch even if required status checks have failed or are pending. You can require administrators to be subject to required status checks.  Administrators can also merge a protected branch even if the branch is out of date with the base branch.

When you view a repository while signed in to your account, the URLs you can use to clone the project onto your computer are available below the repository details:  For information on setting or changing your remote URL, see \"Changing a remote's URL.\"  Cloning with HTTPS URLs (recommended) The https:// clone URLs are available on all repositories, public and private. These URLs work everywhere--even if you are behind a firewall or proxy. In certain cases, if you'd rather use SSH, you might be able to use SSH over the HTTPS port. When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, or if you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you must provide a personal access token instead of entering your password for HTTPS Git.  Tips:  You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub. To clone a repository without authenticating to GitHub on the command line, you can use GitHub Desktop to clone instead.    Cloning with SSH URLs SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. To use these URLs, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the public key to your GitHub account. For information on setting up an SSH keypair, see \"Generating an SSH key.\" When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using SSH URLs, you'll be prompted for a password and must provide your SSH key passphrase. If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you won't be able to clone with SSH. Instead, clone with the HTTPS URL.  Tip: SSH URLs can be used locally, or as a secure way of deploying your code to production servers. You can also use SSH agent forwarding with your deploy script to avoid managing keys on the server.   Cloning with Subversion You can also use a Subversion client to access any repository on GitHub. Subversion offers a vastly different feature set than Git; for a quick overview, see \"What are the differences between Subversion and Git?\" We have a separate article with more information on how to interact with GitHub using Subversion.

For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.  Creating an issues-only repository  GitHub does not provide issues-only access permissions, but you can accomplish this using a second repository which contains only the issues.  Limits for viewing content and diffs in a repository  Certain types of resources can be quite large, requiring excessive processing on GitHub.

For more information, see \"Getting Started with GitHub Desktop.\" If you don't need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:  Creating a repository Forking a repository Managing files Being social   Setting up Git   Download and install the latest version of Git.  Set your username in Git.  Set your commit email address in Git.   Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.  Connecting over HTTPS (recommended) If you clone with HTTPS, you can cache your GitHub password in Git using a credential helper.  Connecting over SSH If you clone with SSH, you must generate SSH keys on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.  Celebrate Congratulations, you now have Git and GitHub all set up!

Need to report a security vulnerability? Please visit our security bug bounty site for information about our responsible disclosure process and to submit a vulnerability report.  Physical Security  Data center access limited to data center technicians and approved GitHub staff Biometric scanning for controlled data center access Security camera monitoring at all data center locations 24x7 onsite staff provides additional protection against unauthorized entry Unmarked facilities to help maintain low profile Physical security audited by an independent firm   System Security  System installation using hardened, patched OS Dedicated firewall and VPN services to help block unauthorized system access Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services powered by industry-leading solutions   Operational Security  Our primary data center operations are regularly audited by independent firms against an ISAE 3000/AT 101 Type 2 Examination standard Systems access logged and tracked for auditing purposes Secure document-destruction policies for all sensitive information Fully documented change-management procedures   Software Security We employ a team of 24/7/365 server specialists at GitHub to keep our software and its dependencies up to date eliminating potential security vulnerabilities. We employ a wide range of monitoring solutions for preventing and eliminating attacks to the site.  Communications All private data exchanged with GitHub is always transmitted over SSL (which is why your dashboard is served over HTTPS, for instance). All pushing and pulling of private data is done over SSH authenticated with keys, or over HTTPS using your GitHub username and password. The SSH login credentials used to push and pull can not be used to access a shell or the filesystem. All users are virtual and have no user account on our machines.  File system and backups Every piece of hardware we use has an identical copy ready and waiting for an immediate hot-swap in case of hardware or software failure. Every line of code we store is saved on a minimum of three different servers, including an off-site backup. We do not retroactively remove repositories from backups when deleted by the user, as we may need to restore the repository for the user if it was removed accidentally. We do not encrypt repositories on disk because it would not be any more secure: the website and git back-end would need to decrypt the repositories on demand, slowing down response times. Any user with shell access to the file system would have access to the decryption routine, thus negating any security it provides. Therefore, we focus on making our machines and network as secure as possible.  Employee access No GitHub employees ever access private repositories unless required to for support reasons. Staff working directly in the file store access the compressed Git database, your code is never present as plaintext files like it would be in a local clone. Support staff may sign into your account to access settings related to your support issue. In rare cases staff may need to pull a clone of your code, this will only be done with your consent. Support staff does not have direct access to clone any repository, they will need to temporarily attach their SSH key to your account to pull a clone. When working a support issue we do our best to respect your privacy as much as possible, we only access the files and settings needed to resolve your issue. All cloned repositories are deleted as soon as the support issue has been resolved.  Maintaining security We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting. All passwords are filtered from all our logs and are one-way encrypted in the database using bcrypt. Login information is always sent over SSL. We also allow you to use two-factor authentication, or 2FA, as an additional security measure when accessing your GitHub account. Enabling 2FA adds security to your account by requiring both your password as well as access to a security code on your phone to access your account. We have full time security staff to help identify and prevent new attack vectors. We always test new features in order to rule out potential attacks, such as XSS-protecting wikis, and ensuring that Pages cannot access cookies. We also maintain relationships with reputable security firms to perform regular penetration tests and ongoing audits of GitHub and its code. We're extremely concerned and active about security, but we're aware that many companies are not comfortable hosting code outside their firewall. For these companies we offer GitHub Enterprise, a version of GitHub that can be installed to a server within the company's network.  Credit card safety When you sign up for a paid account on GitHub, we do not store any of your card information on our servers. It's handed off to Braintree Payment Solutions, a company dedicated to storing your sensitive data on PCI-Compliant servers.  Contact Us Have a question, concern, or comment about GitHub security?

      "body": "GitHub supports Subversion clients via the HTTPS protocol. We use a Subversion bridge to communicate svn commands to GitHub.  Supported Subversion features on GitHub  Checkout The first thing you'll want to do is a Subversion checkout. Since Git clones keep the working directory (where you edit files) separate from the repository data, there is only one branch in the working directory at a time. Subversion checkouts are different: they mix the repository data in the working directories, so there is a working directory for each branch and tag you've checked out. For repositories with many branches and tags, checking out everything can be a bandwidth burden, so you should start with a partial checkout.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.  In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.   Make an empty checkout of the repository:  svn co --depth empty https://github.com/user/repo Checked out revision 1. cd repo    Get the trunk branch. The Subversion bridge maps trunk to the Git HEAD branch (which is usually master).  svn up trunk A trunk A trunk/README.md A trunk/gizmo.rb Updated to revision 1.    Get an empty checkout of the branches directory. This is where all of the non-HEAD branches live, and where you'll be making feature branches.  svn up --depth empty branches Updated to revision 1.     Creating branches You can also create branches using the Subversion bridge to GitHub. From your svn client, make sure \"master\" is current by updating trunk:  svn up trunk At revision 1.  Next, you can use svn copy to create a new branch:  svn copy trunk branches/more_awesome A branches/more_awesome svn commit -m 'Added more_awesome topic branch' Adding branches/more_awesome Committed revision 2.  You can confirm that the new branch exists in the repository's branch dropdown:  You can also confirm the new branch via the command line:  git fetch From https://github.com/user/repo/ * [new branch] more_awesome -&gt; origin/more_awesome   Making commits to Subversion After you've added some features and fixed some bugs, you'll want to commit those changes to GitHub. This works just like the Subversion you're used to. Edit your files, and use svn commit to record your changes:  svn status M gizmo.rb svn commit -m 'Guard against known problems' Sending more_awesome/gizmo.rb Transmitting file data . Committed revision 3. svn status ? test svn add test A test A test/gizmo_test.rb svn commit -m 'Test coverage for problems' Adding more_awesome/test Adding more_awesome/test/gizmo_test.rb Transmitting file data . Committed revision 4.   Switching between branches To switch between branches, you'll probably want to start with a checkout of trunk:  svn co --depth empty https://github.com/user/repo/trunk  Then, you can switch to another branch:  svn switch https://github.com/user/repo/branches/more_awesome   Finding the Git commit SHA for a Subversion commit GitHub's Subversion server exposes the Git commit sha for each Subversion commit. To see the commit SHA, you should ask for the git-commit unversioned remote property.  svn propget git-commit --revprop -r HEAD https://github.com/user/repo 05fcc584ed53d7b0c92e116cb7e64d198b13c4e3  With this commit SHA, you can, for example, look up the corresponding Git commit on GitHub.

For more information, see \"About pull requests\" and \"Commenting on a pull request.\" On your team's page, you can use team discussions for conversations that span across projects or repositories and don't belong in a specific issue or pull request. Instead of opening an issue in a repository to discuss an idea, you can include the entire team by having a conversation in a team discussion. For more information, see \"About team discussions.\"  Reacting to ideas in comments You can show your support or dissent for an idea in a conversation. When you add a reaction to a comment or the body of a team discussion, issue, or pull request, people subscribed to the conversation won't receive a notification.   Tip: You can also add reactions using your mobile device.   Following contribution guidelines Before you open an issue or pull request, check to see if the repository has contributing guidelines. The CONTRIBUTING.md file includes information about how the repository maintainer would like you to contribute ideas to the project. Similar to contributing guidelines, the repository maintainer may have included a template for information to include in an issue or pull request.

Miscellaneous Please see this section for legal details including our choice of law.     The GitHub Terms of Service Effective date: May 25, 2018  A. Definitions Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at help.github.com/categories/site-policy. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms). “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own. An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.   B. Account Terms Short version: User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.  1. Account Controls  Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it. Organizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.   2. Required Information You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.  3. Account Requirements We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub's Service.  You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account. One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws. Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.   4. User Account Security You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.  You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.   5. Additional Terms In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.  C. Acceptable Use Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.  1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.  2. Content Restrictions You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:  is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities; is or contains sexually obscene content; is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent; is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group; contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.   3. Conduct Restrictions While using GitHub, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:  harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users; use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes; attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.   4. Services Usage Limits You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.  5. Scraping Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see Section H for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:  Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access. Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.  You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.  6. Privacy Misuse of GitHub Users' Personal Information is prohibited. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User's Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.  7. Excessive Bandwidth Use If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.  8. User Protection You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.  D. User-Generated Content Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.  1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.  2. GitHub May Remove Content We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.  3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post. Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.  4. License Grant to Us We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.  5. License Grant to Other Users Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control). If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.  6. Contributions Under Repository License Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede. Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We're just making it explicit.  7. Moral Rights You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.  E. Private Repositories Short version: You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.  1. Control of Private Repositories. Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.  2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories. GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.  3. Access. GitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:  With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge. When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems and Service.  You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:  You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.   4. Exclusions. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.  F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.  G. Intellectual Property Notice Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.  1. GitHub's Rights to Content GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.  2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.  3. License to GitHub Policies This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.  H. API Terms Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.  No Abuse or Overuse of the API Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension. You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations. You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement. GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.  I. Additional Terms for GitHub Pages Short version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms. Each GitHub Account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for GitHub users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information. GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.  J. Third Party Applications Short version: You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.  1. Creating Applications If you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub's API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise (\"Developer Product\"), and make it available for other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:  You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement. Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection.  You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content. You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub’s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy. You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.  If you list a Developer Product through GitHub Marketplace, then you must agree to the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement, prior to submitting the project to be listed.   2. Using Third-Party Applications You may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your repositories, including your private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through GitHub Marketplace. Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and often times multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your Account, or you are an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see our Privacy Statement for more information about how we share data with Developer Products.  GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk. If you buy Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern your use of GitHub Marketplace.   K. Advertising on GitHub Short version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.  1. GitHub Pages We offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.  2. GitHub Repositories GitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may not advertise in other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.  3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.  L. Payment Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.  1. Pricing Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.  2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes  We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date. If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately. You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.   3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds  For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.   4. Authorization By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.  5. Responsibility for Payment You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.  M. Cancellation and Termination Short version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.  1. Account Cancellation It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.  2. Upon Cancellation We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled. We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked. Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.  3. GitHub May Terminate GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.  4. Survival All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.  N. Communications with GitHub Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.  1. Electronic Communication Required For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.  2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.  3. No Phone Support GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.  O. Disclaimer of Warranties Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect. GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.  P. Limitation of Liability Short version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you. You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from  the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content; your use or inability to use the Service; any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service; the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available; unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service.  Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.  Q. Release and Indemnification Short version: You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.  R. Changes to These Terms Short version: We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site Policy repository. We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.  S. Miscellaneous  1. Governing Law Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.  2. Non-Assignability GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the GitHub Privacy Statement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.  3. Section Headings and Summaries Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.  4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.  5.

If you don't have a GPG key that matches your committer identity, you need to associate an email with an existing key. For more information, see \"Associating an email with your GPG key\".  If you have multiple GPG keys, you need to tell Git which one to use.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Use the gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG command to list GPG keys for which you have both a public and private key. A private key is required for signing commits or tags.  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG   Note: Some GPG installations on Linux may require you to use gpg2 --list-keys --keyid-format LONG to view a list of your existing keys instead. In this case you will also need to configure Git to use gpg2 by running git config --global gpg.program gpg2.    From the list of GPG keys, copy the GPG key ID you'd like to use.

In this example, the GPG key ID is 3AA5C34371567BD2:  git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C34371567BD2    If you aren't using the GPG suite, paste the text below to add the GPG key to your bash profile:  test -r ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' &gt;&gt; ~/.profile   Note: If you don't have .bash_profile, this command adds your GPG key to .profile.     Telling Git about your X.509 key You can use smimesign to sign commits and tags using S/MIME instead of GPG.  Note: S/MIME signature verification is available in Git 2.19 or later. To update your version of Git, see the Git website.   Install smimesign. Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Configure Git to use S/MIME to sign commits and tags. In Git 2.19 or later, use the git config gpg.x509.program and git config gpg.format commands:   To use S/MIME to sign for all repositories:  git config --global gpg.x509.program smimesign git config --global gpg.format x509    To use S/MIME to sign for a single repository:  cd /path/to/my/repository git config --local gpg.x509.program smimesign git config --local gpg.format x509    In Git 2.18 or earlier, use the git config gpg.program command:   To use S/MIME to sign for all repositories:  git config --global gpg.program smimesign    To use S/MIME to sign for a single repository:  cd /path/to/my/repository git config --local gpg.program smimesign    If you're using an X.509 key that matches your committer identity, you can begin signing commits and tags.   If you're not using an X.509 key that matches your commiter identity, list X.509 keys for which you have both a certificate and private key using the smimesign --list-keys command.  smimesign --list-keys    From the list of X.509 keys, copy the certificate ID of the X.509 key you'd like to use. In this example, the certificate ID is 0ff455a2708394633e4bb2f88002e3cd80cbd76f:  smimesign --list-keys ID: 0ff455a2708394633e4bb2f88002e3cd80cbd76f S/N: a2dfa7e8c9c4d1616f1009c988bb70f Algorithm: SHA256-RSA Validity: 2017-11-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC - 2020-11-22 12:00:00 +0000 UTC Issuer: CN=DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID CA,OU=www.digicert.com,O=DigiCert Inc,C=US Subject: CN=Octocat,O=GitHub\\, Inc.,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US Emails: octocat@github.com    To set your X.509 signing key in Git, paste the text below, substituting in the serial number you'd like to use.

In this example, the GPG key ID is 3AA5C34371567BD2:  git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C34371567BD2     Telling Git about your X.509 key You can use smimesign to sign commits and tags using S/MIME instead of GPG.  Note: S/MIME signature verification is available in Git 2.19 or later. To update your version of Git, see the Git website.   Install smimesign. Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Configure Git to use S/MIME to sign commits and tags. In Git 2.19 or later, use the git config gpg.x509.program and git config gpg.format commands:   To use S/MIME to sign for all repositories:  git config --global gpg.x509.program smimesign git config --global gpg.format x509    To use S/MIME to sign for a single repository:  cd /path/to/my/repository git config --local gpg.x509.program smimesign git config --local gpg.format x509    In Git 2.18 or earlier, use the git config gpg.program command:   To use S/MIME to sign for all repositories:  git config --global gpg.program smimesign    To use S/MIME to sign for a single repository:  cd /path/to/my/repository git config --local gpg.program smimesign    If you're using an X.509 key that matches your committer identity, you can begin signing commits and tags.   If you're not using an X.509 key that matches your commiter identity, list X.509 keys for which you have both a certificate and private key using the smimesign --list-keys command.  smimesign --list-keys    From the list of X.509 keys, copy the certificate ID of the X.509 key you'd like to use. In this example, the certificate ID is 0ff455a2708394633e4bb2f88002e3cd80cbd76f:  smimesign --list-keys ID: 0ff455a2708394633e4bb2f88002e3cd80cbd76f S/N: a2dfa7e8c9c4d1616f1009c988bb70f Algorithm: SHA256-RSA Validity: 2017-11-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC - 2020-11-22 12:00:00 +0000 UTC Issuer: CN=DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID CA,OU=www.digicert.com,O=DigiCert Inc,C=US Subject: CN=Octocat,O=GitHub\\, Inc.,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US Emails: octocat@github.com    To set your X.509 signing key in Git, paste the text below, substituting in the serial number you'd like to use.

You can configure gpgsm to provide encryption and signing services, however, this is not currently supported by GitHub. For more information, see the gpgsm topic in the GnuPG documentation.   Telling Git about your GPG key If you're using a GPG key that matches your committer identity and your verified email address associated with your GitHub account, then you can begin signing commits and signing tags.  If you don't have a GPG key that matches your committer identity, you need to associate an email with an existing key. For more information, see \"Associating an email with your GPG key\".  If you have multiple GPG keys, you need to tell Git which one to use.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Use the gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG command to list GPG keys for which you have both a public and private key. A private key is required for signing commits or tags.  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG   Note: Some GPG installations on Linux may require you to use gpg2 --list-keys --keyid-format LONG to view a list of your existing keys instead.

      "url": "/articles/comparing-commits-across-time",
      "body": "Every repository contains a Compare view, which allows you to compare the state of your repository across branches, tags, commits, time periods, and more. The compare view provides you with the same diff tooling that the Pull Request view does. To get to the compare view, append /compare to your repository's path. We'll demonstrate the power of Compare by looking at the compare page for a fork of the Linguist repo, which is at https://github.com/octocat/linguist/compare/master...octocat:master. Every repository's Compare view contains two drop down menus: base and compare.  base should be considered the starting point of your comparison, and compare is the endpoint. During a comparison, you can always change your base and compare points by clicking on Edit.  Comparing branches The most common use of Compare is to compare branches, such as when you're starting a new Pull Request. You'll always be taken to the branch comparison view when starting a new Pull Request. To compare branches, you can select a branch name from the compare drop down menu at the top of the page. Here's an example of a comparison between two branches.  Comparing tags Similarly, you can compare across tags made for project releases. Comparing against tags is a great way to assemble release notes between different versions of your project. Instead of typing a branch name, type the name of your tag in the compare drop down menu. Here's an example of a comparison between two tags.  Comparing commits You can also compare two arbitrary commits in your repository or its forks on GitHub in a two-dot diff comparison. To quickly compare two commits or Git Object IDs (OIDs) directly with each other in a two-dot diff comparison on GitHub, edit the URL of your repository's \"Comparing changes\" page. For example, this URL uses the shortened seven-character SHA codes to compare commits c3a414e and faf7c6f: https://github.com/github/linguist/compare/c3a414e..faf7c6f. To learn more about other comparison options, see \"Three-dot and two-dot diff comparisons.\"  Comparing across forks You can compare your base repository and any forked repository. This is the view that's presented when a user performs a Pull Request to a project. To compare branches on different repositories, preface the branch names with user names. For example, by specifying octocat:master for base and octo-org:master for compare, you can compare the master branch of the repositories respectively owned by octocat and octo-org. Here's an example of a comparison between two repositories.  Comparisons across time Comparisons can be created for arbitrary time periods, like one month or two weeks. To define a time period, type the branch name, followed by a @, and then the date wrapped between a { } notation. For example, typing master@{2weeks} into the base dropdown menu compares the current master branch against the master branch as it was two weeks prior. Here's an example of a comparison between two time periods. You can also specify a specific date to compare against. Dates must be formatted as MM-DD-YY (month-day-year). Here's an example comparing a branch from 2016-07-22 against that same branch several days later.  Comparisons across commits As a shortcut, Git uses the ^ notation to mean \"one commit prior.\" You can use this notation to compare a single commit or branch against its immediate predecessors. For example, 96d29b7^^^^^ indicates five commits prior to 96d29b7, because there are five ^ marks. Typing 96d29b7^^^^^ in the base branch and 96d29b7 in the compare branch compares the five commits made before 96d29b7 with the 96d29b7 commit. Here's an example of a comparison using the ^ notation.  Further reading  \"Changing the base branch of a pull request\" ",

      "body": " What is a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation? Using a company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse others with regard to its brand or business affiliation may be considered a trademark policy violation.  What is not a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation? Using another's trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a trademark policy violation. GitHub user names are available on a first come, first served basis and may not be reserved. A GitHub account with a user name that happens to be the same as a registered trademark is not, by itself, necessarily a violation of our trademark policy.  How Does GitHub Respond To Reported Trademark Policy Violations? When we receive reports of trademark policy violations from holders of federal or international trademark registrations, we review the account and may take the following actions:  When there is a clear intent to mislead others through the unauthorized use of a trademark, GitHub will suspend the account and notify the account holder. When we determine that an account appears to be confusing users, but is not purposefully passing itself off as the trademarked good or service, we give the account holder an opportunity to clear up any potential confusion. We may also release a username for the trademark holder's active use.   How Do I Report a Trademark Policy Violation? Holders of registered trademarks can report possible trademark policy violations to GitHub via email to support@github.com. Please submit trademark-related requests from your company email address and include all the information requested below to help expedite our response. Also be sure to clearly describe to us why the account may cause confusion with your mark or how the account may dilute or tarnish your mark.  What Information is Required When Reporting Trademark Policy Violations? In order to investigate trademark policy violations, please provide all of the following information:  Username of the reported account Your company name Your company GitHub account (if there is one) Company website Your trademarked word, symbol, etc. Trademark registration number Trademark registration office (e.g., USPTO) Description of confusion (e.g., passing off as your company, including specific descriptions of content or behavior) Requested Action (e.g., removal of violating account or transfer of trademarked username to an existing company account) Include the following statement: \"I have a good faith belief that use of the trademark described above is not authorized by the trademark owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken nominative and other fair uses into consideration.\" Also include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the trademark owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\" Include your physical or electronic signature.  Note: A federal or international trademark registration number is required. If the name you are reporting is not a registered mark (e.g., a government agency or non-profit organization), please let us know:  Your first and last name Title Address Phone Email (must be from company domain)   ",

      "body": "When you click the default Merge pull request option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit. The pull request is merged using the --no-ff option. To merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository.   Squash and merge your pull request commits When you select the Squash and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch. Pull requests with squashed commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To squash and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow squash merging.  You can use squash and merge to create a more streamlined Git history in your repository. Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they aren’t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit while merging to the default branch, you can retain the original changes with a clear Git history.  Rebase and merge your pull request commits When you select the Rebase and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit. Pull requests with rebased commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To rebase and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow rebase merging. The rebase and merge behavior on GitHub deviates slightly from git rebase. Rebase and merge on GitHub will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs, whereas git rebase outside of GitHub does not change the committer information when the rebase happens on top of an ancestor commit. For more information about git rebase, see the \"Git rebase\" chapter from the Pro Git book. For a visual representation of git rebase, see The \"Git Branching - Rebasing\" chapter from the Pro Git book. You aren't able to automatically rebase and merge on GitHub when:  The pull request has merge conflicts. Rebasing the commits from the base branch into the head branch runs into conflicts. Rebasing the commits is considered \"unsafe,\" such as when a rebase is possible without merge conflicts but would produce a different result than a merge would.  If you still want to rebase the commits but can't rebase and merge automatically on GitHub you must:  Rebase the topic branch (or head branch) onto the base branch locally on the command line  Resolve any merge conflicts on the command line. Force-push the rebased commits to the pull request's topic branch (or remote head branch).  Anyone with write permissions in the repository, can then merge the changes using the rebase and merge button on GitHub.  Further reading  \"About pull requests\" \"Addressing merge conflicts\" ",

If you don't have an active SAML session in your browser, you must enter the credentials for your SAML identity provider before you can access the organization. We offer limited support for all identity providers that implement the SAML 2.0 standard. We officially support these identity providers that have been internally tested:  Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Okta OneLogin PingOne Shibboleth   Note: Outside collaborators aren't required to have an external (SAML) identity to access an organization that uses SAML SSO.  You must periodically log in to your SAML provider to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue. You can view and manage your active SAML sessions in your security settings. For more information, see \"Viewing and managing your active SAML sessions.\" To use the API or Git on the command line to access protected content in an organization that uses SAML SSO, you will need to use an authorized personal access token over HTTPS or an authorized SSH key. OAuth App access tokens are authorized by default. If you don't have a personal access token or an SSH key, you can create a personal access token for the command line or generate a new SSH key. For more information, see:  \"Creating a personal access token for the command line\" \"Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent\"  To use a new or existing personal access token or SSH key with an organization that enforces SAML SSO, you will need to authorize the token or authorize the SSH key for use with a SAML SSO organization.

For the exact versions of the Jekyll plugins that GitHub Pages supports, see this list of GitHub Pages dependencies. Other plugins are not supported, so the only way to incorporate them in your site is to generate your site locally and then push your site's static files to your GitHub Pages site. Jekyll is an active open source project. For information on contributing, see the contributing guidelines.  Configuring Jekyll plugins  You must edit your _config.yml file to add Jekyll plugins to your GitHub Pages site.  Sitemaps for GitHub Pages  GitHub Pages can automatically create sitemaps for your projects.  Search engine optimization for GitHub Pages  GitHub Pages can optimize your site for search engines and social media networks, using the Jekyll SEO tag plugin.  Repository metadata on GitHub Pages  Common repository information, such as the project name and description, is available to Jekyll sites hosted on GitHub Pages.  Atom (RSS) feeds for GitHub Pages   GitHub Pages can automatically create an Atom feed for your Jekyll blog. Atom is an XML-based feed format, similar to RSS, that allows other readers to subscribe to new blog posts.  Redirects on GitHub Pages  When a Jekyll post or page's title or date changes, existing links to the site may break. For the security of our users, GitHub Pages does not support customer server configuration files such as .htaccess or .conf. However, using the Jekyll Redirect From plugin, you can automatically redirect visitors to the updated URL.

For more information, see \"Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?\"   What counts as a contribution On your profile page, certain actions count as contributions:  Committing to a repository's default branch or gh-pages branch Opening an issue Proposing a pull request Submitting a pull request review Co-authoring commits in a repository's default branch or gh-pages branch   Notes:  To appear on your profile contributions graph, co-authored commits must meet the same criteria as commits with one author. When a pull request is merged and commits are squashed, only the user that merged the pull request and the user that opened the pull request receive contribution credit. No other contributors to the pull request will receive contribution credit.

Viewing contributions from specific times  Click on a day's square to show the contributions made during that 24-hour period. Press Shift and click on another day's square to show contributions made during that timespan.   Note: You can select up to a one-month range on your contributions calendar. If you select a larger timespan, we will only display one month of contributions.    How contribution event times are calculated Timestamps are calculated differently for commits and pull requests:   Commits use the time zone information in the commit timestamp. For more information, see \"Troubleshooting commits on your timeline.\"  Pull requests and issues opened on GitHub use your browser's time zone. Those opened via the API use the timestamp or time zone specified in the API call.   Activity overview  Note: The activity overview section is currently in beta and subject to change.  When you enable the activity overview section on your profile, viewers can see more information about the types of contributions you make and repositories you're most active in. A viewer can only see information in the activity overview about repositories they have read access to. Once enabled, a viewer can also filter your contribution graph and activity timeline for a specific organization. For more information, see \"Showing an overview of your activity on your profile.\"  The organizations featured in the activity overview are prioritized according to how active you are in the organization. If you @mention an organization in your profile bio, and you’re an organization member, then that organization is prioritized first in the activity overview. For more information, see “Mentioning people and teams” or \"Adding a bio to your profile.\"  Contribution activity The contribution activity section includes a detailed timeline of your work, including commits you've made or co-authored, pull requests you've proposed, and issues you've opened. You can see your contributions over time by either clicking Show more activity at the bottom of your contribution activity or by clicking the year you're interested in viewing on the right side of the page. Important moments, like the date you joined an organization, proposed your first pull request, or opened a high-profile issue, are highlighted in your contribution activity.

You can enforce HTTPS for your GitHub Pages site to transparently redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.  All GitHub Pages sites, including sites that are correctly configured with a custom domain, support HTTPS and HTTPS enforcement. For more information about custom domains, see \"Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages.\" For information about troubleshooting HTTPS with custom domains, see \"Troubleshooting custom domains.\" HTTPS enforcement is required for GitHub Pages sites using a github.io domain that were created after June 15, 2016. If you created your GitHub Pages site before June 15, 2016, you can manually enable HTTPS enforcement.  Tip: GitHub Pages sites shouldn't be used for sensitive transactions like sending passwords or credit card numbers.   Enforcing HTTPS for your GitHub Pages site  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings.  Under \"GitHub Pages,\" select Enforce HTTPS.    Resolving problems with mixed content If you enable HTTPS for your site, and your site's HTML still references images, CSS, or JavaScript over HTTP, then your site is serving mixed content, and you may have trouble loading assets. Serving mixed content also makes your site less secure. To remove your site's mixed content, improve your site's security, and resolve problems related to loading mixed content, edit your site's HTML files and change http:// to https:// so that all of your assets are served over HTTPS. For GitHub Pages sites that use Jekyll, your HTML files will most likely be stored in the _layouts folder. In general, CSS is found in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML file. JavaScript is usually in the &lt;head&gt; section or just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag. Images are often in the &lt;body&gt; section.  Tip: If you can't find where your assets are found in your site, try searching your site's code for http in your text editor or on GitHub.   Examples of how assets may be referenced in an HTML file    Asset type HTTP HTTPS     CSS &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://example.com/css/main.css\"&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://example.com/css/main.css\"&gt;   JavaScript &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://example.com/js/main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://example.com/js/main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   Image &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.somesite.com\"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=\"http://www.example.com/logo.jpg\" alt=\"Logo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;A HREF=\"https://www.somesite.com\"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=\"https://www.example.com/logo.jpg\" alt=\"Logo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     Further reading  \"What is GitHub Pages?\" \"Troubleshooting custom domains\" ",

For steps on creating gists, see \"Creating gists.\"  Public gists Public gists show up in Discover, where people can browse new gists as they're created. They're also searchable, so you can use them if you'd like other people to find and see your work. After creating a gist, you cannot convert it from public to secret.  Secret gists Secret gists don't show up in Discover and are not searchable. Use them to jot down an idea that came to you in a dream, create a to-do list, or prepare some code or prose that's not ready to be shared with the world. After creating a gist, you cannot convert it from public to secret. Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist. If you need to keep your code away from prying eyes, you may want to create a private repository instead.  Discovering and searching for other people's gists You can discover gists others have created by going to the gist home page and clicking All Gists. This will take you to a page of all gists sorted and displayed by time of creation or update. You can also search gists by language with Gist Search. Gist search uses the same search syntax as code search.  Forking and cloning gists Since gists are Git repositories, you can view their full commit history, complete with diffs. You can also fork or clone gists. For more information, see \"Forking and cloning gists\".  Downloading gists You can download a ZIP file of a gist by clicking the Download ZIP button at the top of the gist.

For more information, see \"Permission levels for an organization.\" You will also need access to modify domain records with your domain hosting service. After verifying ownership of your organization's domains, a \"Verified\" badge will display on the organization's profile. For more information, see \"About your organization's profile page.\" To display a \"Verified\" badge, the website and email information shown on your organization's profile must match the verified domain or domains. If the website and email address shown on your organization's profile are hosted on different domains, you must verify both domains.  Note: If the email address and website shown on your organization's profile use variants of the same domain, you must verify both variants. For example, if your organization's profile shows the website www.example.com and the email address info@example.com, you would need to verify both www.example.com and example.com.

You and your collaborators can create branches when working on wikis, but only changes pushed to the master branch will be made live and available to your readers.  About wiki filenames The filename determines the title of your wiki page, and the file extension determines how your wiki content is rendered. Wikis use our open-source Markup library to convert the markup, and it determines which converter to use by a file's extension. For example, if you name a file foo.md or foo.markdown, wiki will use the Markdown converter, while a file named foo.textile will use the Textile converter. Don't use the following characters in your wiki page's titles: \\ / : * ? \" &lt; &gt; |. Users on certain operating systems won't be able to work with filenames containing these characters. Be sure to write your content using a markup language that matches the extension, or your content won't render properly.",

If you lose access to your phone, you can authenticate to GitHub using your recovery codes. You can also download your recovery codes at any point after enabling two-factor authentication. To keep your account secure, don't share or distribute your recovery codes.

For more information, see \"Configuring two-factor authentication.\"  Setting a fallback authentication number You can provide a second number for a fallback device. If you lose access to both your primary device and your recovery codes, a backup SMS number can get you back in to your account. You can use a fallback number regardless of whether you've configured authentication via text message or TOTP mobile application.  Warning: Using a fallback number is a last resort. We recommend configuring additional recovery methods if you set a fallback authentication number.  Bad actors may attack cell phone carriers, so SMS authentication is risky.

Adding a fallback authentication method with Recover Accounts Elsewhere You can generate an extra authentication credential for your account and store it with a partner recovery provider.  About Recover Accounts Elsewhere With Recover Accounts Elsewhere, you can add an extra security factor to your GitHub account in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication method or recovery codes. Recover Accounts Elsewhere lets you associate your GitHub account with your Facebook account. You can store an authentication credential in the form of an account recovery token for your GitHub account with Facebook. If you lose access to your GitHub account because you no longer have access to your two-factor authentication method or recovery codes, you can retrieve your account recovery token from the recovery provider to help prove that you're the owner of your GitHub account. After you retrieve your token, GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support may be able to disable two-factor authentication for your account. Then, you can provide or reset your password to regain access to your account. Your account recovery token is valid for a year or until you use it. If you retrieve your token or your token expires, you should generate and store a new token. When you generate or retrieve an account recovery token, an event is added to your account's audit log.

For more information, see \"Sorting search results.\" GitHub search uses an ElasticSearch cluster to index projects every time a change is pushed to GitHub. Issues and pull requests are indexed when they are created or modified.  Types of searches on GitHub You can search the following types of information across all public GitHub repositories, and all private GitHub repositories you have access to:  Repositories Topics Issues and pull requests Code Commits Users Wikis   Searching using a visual interface Alternatively, you can search GitHub using the search page or advanced search page. The advanced search page provides a visual interface for constructing search queries. You can filter your searches by a variety of factors, such as the number of stars or number of forks a repository has. As you fill in the advanced search fields, your query will automatically be constructed in the top search bar.   Searching across GitHub Enterprise and GitHub.com simultaneously If you use GitHub Enterprise and you're a member of a GitHub.com organization using GitHub Enterprise Cloud, your GitHub Enterprise site administrator can enable GitHub Connect so that you can search across both environments at the same time.

      "url": "/articles/about-git-rebase",
      "body": " The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together.  Typically, you would use git rebase to:  Edit previous commit messages Combine multiple commits into one Delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary   Warning: Because changing your commit history can make things difficult for everyone else using the repository, it's considered bad practice to rebase commits when you've already pushed to a repository. To learn how to safely rebase on GitHub, see \"About pull request merges.\"   Rebasing commits against a branch To rebase all the commits between another branch and the current branch state, you can enter the following command in your shell (either the command prompt for Windows, or the terminal for Mac and Linux):  git rebase --interactive other_branch_name   Rebasing commits against a point in time To rebase the last few commits in your current branch, you can enter the following command in your shell:  git rebase --interactive HEAD~7   Commands available while rebasing There are six commands available while rebasing:  pick  pick simply means that the commit is included. Rearranging the order of the pick commands changes the order of the commits when the rebase is underway. If you choose not to include a commit, you should delete the entire line.  reword The reword command is similar to pick, but after you use it, the rebase process will pause and give you a chance to alter the commit message. Any changes made by the commit are not affected.  edit If you choose to edit a commit, you'll be given the chance to amend the commit, meaning that you can add or change the commit entirely. You can also make more commits before you continue the rebase. This allows you to split a large commit into smaller ones, or, remove erroneous changes made in a commit.  squash This command lets you combine two or more commits into a single commit. A commit is squashed into the commit above it. Git gives you the chance to write a new commit message describing both changes. fixup This is similar to squash, but the commit to be merged has its message discarded. The commit is simply merged into the commit above it, and the earlier commit's message is used to describe both changes. exec This lets you run arbitrary shell commands against a commit.   An example of using git rebase  No matter which command you use, Git will launch your default text editor and open a file that details the commits in the range you've chosen. That file looks something like this: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A pick 6b2481b Patch B pick dd1475d something I want to split pick c619268 A fix for Patch B pick fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B # Rebase 41a72e6..7b36971 onto 41a72e6 # # Commands: # p, pick = use commit # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell # # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST. # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted. #  Breaking this information, from top to bottom, we see that:  Seven commits are listed, which indicates that there were seven changes between our starting point and our current branch state. The commits you chose to rebase are sorted in the order of the oldest changes (at the top) to the newest changes (at the bottom). Each line lists a command (by default, pick), the commit SHA, and the commit message. The entire git rebase procedure centers around your manipulation of these three columns. The changes you make are rebased onto your repository. After the commits, Git tells you the range of commits we're working with (41a72e6..7b36971). Finally, Git gives some help by telling you the commands that are available to you when rebasing commits.

For more information, see \"Linking a repository to a project board.\"  Admin, which gives people permission to view a project board, interact with a project board, manage project board settings, and manage other people's access to the project board.  Organization owners and people with admin permissions can give a person access to an organization project board individually, as an outside collaborator or organization member, or through their membership in a team or organization. An outside collaborator is someone who is not an organization member but given permissions to collaborate in your organization. Organization owners and people with admin permissions to a project board can also:  Set default project board permissions for all organization members.

GitHub Pages is designed to work with two types of custom domains: apex domains and subdomains.  Custom domain redirects for GitHub Pages sites  The type of pages site you're using determines how your site redirects custom domains.

Setting up an apex domain and www subdomain  You can set up an apex domain and a www subdomain through your DNS provider and GitHub Pages' servers will automatically create redirects between them. For example, your site can be found at www.example.com or example.com.  Setting up an apex domain  To set up an apex domain, such as example.com, you must configure an ALIAS, ANAME, or A record with your DNS provider.  Setting up a www subdomain  To set up a www subdomain, such as www.example.com you must configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider.  Setting up a custom subdomain  You can set up a custom subdomain, such as blog.example.com, by creating a CNAME record through your DNS provider.  Troubleshooting custom domains  If your GitHub Pages site isn't loading at your custom domain or HTTPS isn't working, you can troubleshoot by reviewing common setup and configuration problems.",

Tip: For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see \"Which remote URL should I use?\"  The git remote set-url command takes two arguments:  An existing remote name. For example, origin or upstream are two common choices.  A new URL for the remote. For example:   If you're updating to use HTTPS, your URL might look like:  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git    If you're updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git       Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.

      "category_url": "/categories/site-policy",
      "url": "/articles/github-statement-against-modern-slavery-and-child-labor",
      "body": "2018 statement According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 40 million people were victims of modern slavery and 152 million children were subject to child labor globally in 2016. As the ILO reports:  1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children. Out of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labour, 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labour imposed by state authorities.  Women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labour, accounting for 99% of victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors.  GitHub deplores the presence and persistence of modern slavery and child labor, and takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that neither modern slavery nor child labor takes place in its supply chain or in any part of its business. (\"Modern slavery\" in this statement refers to slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, and workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded. \"Child labor\" refers to work performed by someone under 16 years of age, or under 14 for light work, provided it is not confined to periods that interfere with the child's schooling and not in conditions that interfere with the child's health or well-being.) In accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act, and in alignment with the ILO 2014 Protocol to its Forced Labour Convention, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target 8.7, this 2018 Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor (\"the Statement\") describes the steps GitHub has taken to prevent modern slavery and child labor from occurring in its business or supply chain.  GitHub's structure, business, and supply chains GitHub is a software development platform with its headquarters in San Francisco, and employees and contractors working in numerous countries. All GitHub employees and individual independent contractors are voluntary and at-will. GitHub has a largely distributed workforce, and strives to provide competitive compensation and benefits to its employees and contractors regardless of location. This is true whether we hire independent contractors directly or through an intermediary. GitHub does not conduct manufacturing or produce hardware, nor does GitHub use recruitment agencies for the kinds of services often performed by migrant workers. The nature of GitHub's business does not subject it to sudden changes in workload or pricing pressures, which often drive demand for practices that increase the risk of forced labor in supply chains, such as forced overtime. GitHub offers free and paid software and web-based software as a service to customers all over the world. GitHub's products include:  GitHub.com: web-based collaboration and code-hosting platform GitHub Enterprise: on-premises collaboration and code hosting software Atom: text editor Electron: framework for writing cross-platform desktop apps GitHub Desktop: desktop app for accessing GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise  GitHub's supply chain consists of goods and services for our products and operations including computing services, event planning, purchase of retail and promotional items, office supplies, and leasing of facilities such as office space and data centers.  Policies in relation to modern slavery and child labor  Modern slavery and child labor GitHub's Code of Ethics prohibits knowingly using, participating in, supporting, or tolerating modern slavery (slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, or workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded) or child labor in its business operations. Any GitHub employee or contractor who violates this prohibition will be subject to termination of employment or business relationship. GitHub's Standards of Conduct prohibit unsafe and illegal conduct, including knowingly using, participating in, supporting, or tolerating modern slavery (slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, or workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded) or child labor. GitHub complies with laws prohibiting trafficking and child labor in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation 22.17 on combatting human trafficking. In addition, GitHub established a partnership with the FairHotel Program, which means GitHub encourages its employees to choose FairHotel endorsed hotels-where workers have fair wages, adequate benefits, and a voice on the job. Being a FairHotel partner also signifies that GitHub provides business to hotels as a fair employer. Going forward, GitHub will communicate this Statement to all employees, contractors, and suppliers, including recruiters and employment agencies. In addition, GitHub is developing training for all GitHub employees on modern slavery and child labor. GitHub posts its Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor publicly. GitHub has a non-retaliation policy for reporting workplace-related concerns. Consistent with this Statement, GitHub allows employees and contractors to report issues regarding modern slavery and child labor without fear of retaliation.  Labor laws and practices GitHub's labor practices are fair:  GitHub pays its employees and contractors a fair wage, in accordance with applicable legal wages GitHub maintains humane working conditions GitHub does not require workers to exceed the maximum hours of daily labor set by local and national laws or regulations GitHub pays its employees and contractors in a timely manner, with documentation (such as a pay stub) stating the basis on which they are paid, and keeps employee records in accordance with local and national laws  humane and ethical:  GitHub uses only voluntary labor GitHub prohibits child labor GitHub does not engage in physical discipline or abuse GitHub does not tolerate harassment or unlawful discrimination in the workforce or workplace  respectful:  GitHub protects its employees' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with legal requirements, including to post legal notices of employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act GitHub provides benefits to employees at or in excess of levels expected in the industry GitHub encourages employees to report any workplace complaint and does not tolerate retaliation for reporting   Due diligence processes in relation to modern slavery and child labor in its business and supply chains GitHub assesses its business and supply chain for risks related to modern slavery and child labor. Drawing on internal and external human rights expertise, GitHub engaged in a cross-functional analysis (including Policy, Legal, Procurement, Finance, and Operations, especially Human Resources) to determine where labor services exist in its business and supply chain and to identify potential risks related to modern slavery and child labor. GitHub prioritizes areas where those risks might be more significant in terms of severity, scale, or probability for greater due diligence, monitoring, and verification. GitHub continues to consider where risks may occur and how to address them. In addition, GitHub now obtains its suppliers' assurance that they have practices consistent with this Statement, including by complying with laws related to modern slavery or child labor.  Places in GitHub's business and supply chains where there is a risk of modern slavery and child labor, and steps GitHub has taken to assess and manage that risk GitHub has not identified any high-risk suppliers; however, modern slavery or child labor would be more likely to occur with suppliers for services involving manual labor, such as event support, construction, facilities services, and food services. GitHub will audit its existing suppliers and require those in such higher risk areas to confirm that they provide services consistent with this Statement. Although GitHub knows of no actual or alleged modern slavery or child labor in its business or supply chain, and has no credible basis to believe it is occurring, GitHub is committed to providing remedies if GitHub itself were to directly cause modern slavery or child labor and to remediation of broader patterns of non-conformance with this Statement caused by deficiencies in GitHub's systems or processes. GitHub's remediation to individual victims would include protocols for appropriate immediate action to eliminate the modern slavery and child labor practices, along with resources for reasonable and appropriate victim services designed to offset the harm experienced.  Effectiveness in ensuring neither modern slavery nor child labor is occurring in GitHub's business or supply chains GitHub complies and will continue to comply with laws related to modern slavery and child labor. Going forward, GitHub now requires its suppliers to comply with this Statement, as well as laws related to modern slavery and child labor. GitHub now also requires its suppliers to:  not use, participate in, support, or tolerate modern slavery or child labor not use misleading or fraudulent recruitment or engagement practices for employees or contract workers not charge employees or contract workers recruitment or engagement fees not destroy, conceal, confiscate, or otherwise deny access by an employee or any contract worker to passport, driver's license, or other identity documents; allow us to terminate our agreements with them for any violation of its obligations related to modern slavery or child labor; and remediate any harms caused to any worker found to be subjected to any form of modern slavery or child labor, if required by law.  In addition, GitHub strongly encourages its suppliers to:  conduct anti-modern slavery and child labor due diligence processes, including risk assessments, for their suppliers; take steps to address risks identified; and use similar anti-modern slavery and child labor language with their suppliers.  GitHub's procurement instructions to employees making company purchases now includes a reference to the requirement for suppliers to comply with this Statement.  Training for GitHub staff about modern slavery and human trafficking GitHub is developing modern slavery and child labor training that will be mandatory for all employees, with a view to GitHub's business and supply chain. GitHub will emphasize suppliers providing services involving manual labor, such as event support, construction, facilities services, and food services, as areas of greater potential risk. GitHub's Board of Directors approved this Statement.",

      "body": " If you need to manage multiple projects within a single repository, you can use a subtree merge to handle all the references.  Typically, a subtree merge is used to contain a repository within a repository. The \"subrepository\" is stored in a folder of the main repository. The best way to explain subtree merges is to show by example. We will:  Make an empty repository called test that represents our project Merge another repository into it as a subtree called Spoon-Knife. The test project will use that subproject as if it were part of the same repository. Fetch updates from Spoon-Knife into our test project.   Setting up the empty repository for a subtree merge  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Create a new directory and navigate to it.  mkdir test cd test    Initialize a new Git repository.  git init Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/octocat/tmp/test/.git/    Create and commit a new file.  touch .gitignore git add .gitignore git commit -m \"initial commit\" [master (root-commit) 3146c2a] initial commit  0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)  create mode 100644 .gitignore     Adding a new repository as a subtree   Add a new remote URL pointing to the separate project that we're interested in.  git remote add -f spoon-knife git@github.com:octocat/Spoon-Knife.git Updating spoon-knife warning: no common commits remote: Counting objects: 1732, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (750/750), done. remote: Total 1732 (delta 1086), reused 1558 (delta 967) Receiving objects: 100% (1732/1732), 528.19 KiB | 621 KiB/s, done.

Tip: If you create a fresh clone of the repository in the future, the remotes you've added will not be created for you. You will have to add them again using the git remote add command.   Synchronizing with updates and changes When a subproject is added, it is not automatically kept in sync with the upstream changes. You will need to update the subproject with the following command:  git pull -s subtree remotename branchname  For the example above, this would be:  git pull -s subtree spoon-knife master   Further reading  The \"Subtree Merging\" chapter from the Pro Git book \"How to use the subtree merge strategy\" ",

You can also suggest specific changes to a line, which the author can apply directly from the pull request. For more information, see \"Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request.\" Repository owners and collaborators can request a pull request review from a specific person. Organization members can also request a pull request review from a team with read access to the repository. For more information, see \"Requesting a pull request review.\" Reviews allow for discussion of proposed changes and help ensure that the changes meet the repository's contributing guidelines and other quality standards. You can define which individuals or teams own certain types or areas of code in a CODEOWNERS file. When a pull request modifies code that has a defined owner, that individual or team will automatically be requested as a reviewer. For more information, see \"About code owners.\"  A review has three possible statuses:   Comment: Submit general feedback without explicitly approving the changes or requesting additional changes.  Approve: Submit feedback and approve merging the changes proposed in the pull request.  Request changes: Submit feedback that must be addressed before the pull request can be merged.    Tips:  If required reviews are enabled and a collaborator with write, admin, or owner access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request. Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approving review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable. If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed. The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged. When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you won’t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.   You can view all of the reviews a pull request has received in the Conversation timeline, and you can see reviews by repository owners and collaborators in the pull request's merge box.   Tip: You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier review-requested:[USERNAME] or team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]. For more information, see \"Searching issues and pull requests.\"   Resolving conversations You can resolve a conversation in a pull request if you opened the pull request or if you have write access to the repository where the pull request was opened. To indicate that a conversation on the Files changed tab is complete, click Resolve conversation.  The entire conversation will be collapsed and marked as resolved, making it easier to find conversations that still need to be addressed.   Required reviews Repository administrators can require that all pull requests receive a specific number of approving reviews from people with write or admin permissions in the repository or from a designated code owner before they're merged into a protected branch. For more information, see \"About protected branches.\" When required reviews are enabled, anyone with access to the repository can approve changes in a pull request. However, you won't be able to merge your pull request until the required number of reviewers with write or admin permissions in the repository approve your pull request's changes in their review. For more information about repository permission levels, see \"Repository permission levels for an organization.\" If review is required from a designated code owner and the pull request affects code that has a designated owner, approval from that owner is required. For more information, see \"About required reviews for pull requests.\"  Tip: If necessary, people with admin or write access to a repository can dismiss a pull request review.

      "url": "/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice",
      "body": "This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a DMCA takedown request. If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy. Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible. These guidelines are designed to make the processing of alleged infringement notices as straightforward as possible. Our form of notice set forth below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: http://www.copyright.gov. As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.  Before You Start Tell the Truth. The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued for money damages. The DMCA itself provides for damages against any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing. Investigate. Millions of users and organizations pour their hearts and souls into the projects they create and contribute to on GitHub. Filing a DMCA complaint against such a project is a serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people. Because of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown to make sure that the use isn't actually permissible. Ask Nicely First. A great first step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly. They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README, or you could get in touch by opening an issue or pull request on the repository. This is not strictly required, but it is classy. Send In The Correct Request. We can only accept DMCA takedown notices for works that are protected by copyright, and that identify a specific copyrightable work. If you have a complaint about trademark abuse, please see our trademark policy. If you wish to remove sensitive data such as passwords, please see our policy on sensitive data. If you are dealing with defamation or other abusive behavior, please see our Community Guidelines. Code Is Different From Other Creative Content. GitHub is built for collaboration on software code. This makes identifying a valid copyright infringement more complicated than it might otherwise be for, say, photos, music, or videos.  There are a number of reasons why code is different from other creative content. For instance:  A repository may include bits and pieces of code from many different people, but only one file or even a sub-routine within a file infringes your copyrights.  Code mixes functionality with creative expression, but copyright only protects the expressive elements, not the parts that are functional. There are often licenses to consider. Just because a piece of code has a copyright notice does not necessarily mean that it is infringing. It is possible that the code is being used in accordance with an open-source license. A particular use may be fair-use if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately. Code may be alleged to infringe in many different ways, requiring detailed explanations and identifications of works.  This list isn't exhaustive, which is why speaking to a legal professional about your proposed complaint is doubly important when dealing with code. No Bots. You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send. If you are outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down projects! Matters of Copyright Are Hard. It can be very difficult to determine whether or not a particular work is protected by copyright. For example, facts (including data) are generally not copyrightable. Words and short phrases are generally not copyrightable. URLs and domain names are generally not copyrightable. Since you can only use the DMCA process to target content that is protected by copyright, you should speak with a lawyer if you have questions about whether or not your content is protectable.  You May Receive a Counter Notice. Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a counter notice. If they do, we will re-enable their content within 10-14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. Your Complaint Will Be Published. As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable takedown notices at https://github.com/github/dmca. GitHub Isn't The Judge. GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.  Your Complaint Must ...  Include the following statement: \"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.\" We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete complaint if you don't include this statement. But we'll know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so. Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed. This information is important because it helps the affected user evaluate your claim and give them the ability to compare your work to theirs. The specificity of your identification will depend on the nature of the work you believe has been infringed. If you have published your work, you might be able to just link back to a web page where it lives. If it is proprietary and not published, you might describe it and explain that it is proprietary. If you have registered it with the Copyright Office, you should include the registration number. If you are alleging that the hosted content is a direct, literal copy of your work, you can also just explain that fact. Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above. It is important to be as specific as possible in your identification. This identification needs to be reasonably sufficient to permit GitHub to locate the material. At a minimum, this means that you should include the URL to the material allegedly infringing your copyright. If you allege that less than a whole repository infringes, identify the specific file(s) or line numbers within a file that you allege infringe. If you allege that all of the content at a URL infringes, please be explicit about that as well. Finally, please note that GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. If you have investigated and analyzed the forks of a repository and believe that they are also infringing, please explicitly identify each allegedly infringing fork. Please also confirm that you have investigated each individual case and that your sworn statements apply to each identified fork. Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement. Again, specificity is important. When we pass your complaint along to the user, this will tell them what they need to do in order to avoid having the rest of their content disabled. Does the user just need to add a statement of attribution? Do they need to delete certain lines within their code, or entire files? Of course, we understand that in some cases, all of a user's content may be alleged to infringe and there's nothing they could do short of deleting it all. If that's the case, please make that clear as well. Provide your contact information. Include your email address, name, telephone number and physical address. Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer. Usually this will be satisfied by providing the GitHub username associated with the allegedly infringing content. But there may be cases where you have additional knowledge about the alleged infringer. If so, please share that information with us. Include the following statement: \"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.\" Also include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\" Include your physical or electronic signature.   Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology The Copyright Act also prohibits the circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access to works protected by copyright. If you believe that content hosted on GitHub violates this prohibition, please send us a report through our Copyright claims form, and include specific information about what content violates that prohibition, what technological measures you had in place, and why the content violates the prohibition.   How to Submit Your Complaint The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our Copyright claims form. You can also send an email notification to copyright@github.com. You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message. If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is: GitHub, Inc Attn: DMCA Agent 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St San Francisco, CA. 94107 ",

A person with write access to the repository can delete sensitive information from the edit history. For more information, see \"Tracking changes in a comment.\"  Hiding a comment If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.   Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click Hide.    Using the \"Choose a reason\" drop-down menu, click a reason to hide the comment. Then click, Hide comment.     Unhiding a comment  Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click  Show comment.   On the right side of the expanded comment, click , then Unhide.     Editing a comment It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's Community Guidelines. When you edit a comment, note the location that the content was removed from and optionally, the reason for removing it. The edited dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.   Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.

Organization members can send a notification to an entire team by mentioning the team's name. Organization members can also send a notification to an entire team by requesting a review from that team. Organization members can request reviews from specific teams with read access to the repository where the pull request is opened. Teams can be designated as owners of certain types or areas of code in a CODEOWNERS file. For more information, see:  \"Managing team access to an organization repository\" \"Mentioning people and teams\" \"About code owners\"    Team visibility Teams can be visible or secret:  Visible teams can be viewed and @mentioned by every organization member. Secret teams are only visible to the people on the team and people with owner permissions. They're great for hiding teams with sensitive names or members, such as those used for working with external partners or clients. Secret teams cannot be nested under parent teams or have child teams.   Team pages Each team has its own page within an organization. On a team's page, you can view team members, child teams, and the team's repositories. Organization owners and team maintainers can access team settings and update the team's description and profile picture from the team's page. Organization members can create and participate in discussions with the team. For more information, see \"About team discussions.\"   Nested teams You can reflect your group or company's hierarchy within your GitHub organization with multiple levels of nested teams. A parent team can have multiple child teams, while each child team only has one parent team. You cannot nest secret teams. Child teams inherit the parent's access permissions, simplifying permissions management for large groups. Members of child teams also receive notifications when the parent team is @mentioned, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people. For example, if your team structure is Employees &gt; Engineering &gt; Application Engineering &gt; Identity, granting Engineering write access to a repository means Application Engineering and Identity also get that access. If you @mention the Identity Team or any team at the bottom of the organization hierarchy, they're the only ones who will receive a notification.  To easily understand who shares a parent team's permissions and mentions, you can see all of the members of a parent team's child teams on the Members tab of the parent team's page. Members of a child team are not direct members of the parent team.  You can choose a parent when you create the team, or you can move a team in your organization's hierarchy later. For more information see, \"Moving a team in your organization’s hierarchy.\"  Preparing to nest teams in your organization If your organization already has existing teams, you should audit each team's repository access permissions before you nest teams above or below it. You should also consider the new structure you'd like to implement for your organization. At the top of the team hierarchy, you should give parent teams repository access permissions that are safe for every member of the parent team and its child teams. As you move toward the bottom of the hierarchy, you can grant child teams additional, more granular access to more sensitive repositories.  Remove all members from existing teams Audit and adjust each team's repository access permissions and give each team a parent Create any new teams you'd like to, choose a parent for each new team, and give them repository access Add people directly to teams   Further reading  \"Creating a team\" \"Adding organization members to a team\" ",

Contacting the application developer Because an application is developed by a third-party who isn't GitHub, we don't know exactly how an application uses the data it's requesting access to. You can use the developer information at the top of the page to contact the application admin if you have questions or concerns about their application.  If the developer has chosen to supply it, the right-hand side of the page provides a detailed description of the application, as well as its associated website.   Types of application access and data Applications can have read or write access to your GitHub data.   Read access only allows an application to look at your data.  Write access allows an application to change your data.   About OAuth scopes Scopes are named groups of permissions that an application can request to access both public and non-public data. When you want to use a third-party application that integrates with GitHub, that application lets you know what type of access to your data will be required. If you grant access to the application, then the application will be able to perform actions on your behalf, such as reading or modifying data. For example, if you want to use an app that requests user:email scope, the app will have read-only access to your private email addresses. For more information, see \"About scopes for OAuth Apps\" in the GitHub Developer documentation.  Note: Currently, you can't scope source code access to read-only.   Types of requested data There are several types of data that applications can request.   Tip: We recommend that you regularly review your authorized integrations. Remove any applications and tokens that haven't been used in a while.     Type of data Description     Commit status You can grant access for a third-party application to report your commit status. Commit status access allows applications to determine if a build is a successful against a specific commit. Applications won't have access to your code, but they can read and write status information against a specific commit.   Deployments Deployment status access allows applicationss to determine if a deployment is successful against a specific commit for public and private repositories. Applicationss won't have access to your code.   Gists  Gist access allows applications to read or write to both your public and secret Gists.   Hooks  Webhooks access allows applications to read or write hook configurations on repositories you manage.   Notifications Notification access allows applicationss to read your GitHub notifications, such as comments on issues and pull requests. However, applications remain unable to access anything in your repositories.   Organizations and teams Organization and teams access allows apps to access and manage organization and team membership.   Personal user data User data includes information found in your user profile, like your name, e-mail address, and location.   Repositories Repository information includes the names of contributors, the branches you've created, and the actual files within your repository. Applications can request access for either public or private repositories on a user-wide level.   Repository delete Applications can request to delete repositories that you administer, but they won't have access to your code.     Requesting updated permissions Applications can request new access privileges. When asking for updated permissions, the application will notify you of the differences. ",

      "body": "With two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to provide an authentication code when accessing GitHub through the website, via the API, or via GitHub Desktop. If you access GitHub using other methods, you'll need to provide an alternative second form of authentication.  In this guide   Providing a 2FA code when signing in to the website  Generating a code through a TOTP application Receiving a text message Using a FIDO U2F compatible security key   Using two-factor authentication with the API Using two-factor authentication with GitHub Desktop  Using two-factor authentication with the command line  Authenticating on the command line using HTTPS Authenticating on the command line using SSH   Using two-factor authentication to access a repository using Subversion Troubleshooting   Providing a 2FA code when signing in to the website After you sign in to GitHub using your password, you'll be prompted to provide an authentication code from a text message or your TOTP app. GitHub will only ask you to provide your 2FA authentication code again if you've logged out, are using a new device, or your session expires.  Tip: If you're providing a recovery code instead of an authentication code, make sure you do not enter your recovery code in the authentication code field. For more information, see \"Recovering your account if you lose your 2FA credentials.\"   Generating a code through a TOTP application If you chose to set up two-factor authentication using a TOTP application on your smartphone, you can generate an authentication code for GitHub at any time. In most cases, just launching the application will generate a new code. You should refer to your application's documentation for specific instructions. If you delete the mobile application after configuring two-factor authentication, you'll need to provide your recovery code to get access to your account. For more information, see \"Recovering your account if you lose your two-factor authentication credentials\"  Receiving a text message If you set up two-factor authentication via text messages, GitHub will send you a text message with your authentication code.  Using a FIDO U2F compatible security key If you set up two-factor authentication via a security key, you can authenticate to GitHub on your computer or compatible Android phone with Near Field Communication (NFC) support instead of using codes generated by a TOTP application or text message. For specific instructions for authenticating with a security key, see the documentation for your device.  In the Chrome browser on your Android phone, navigate to www.github.com. Tap  &gt; Sign in.   Enter your username and password, then click Sign in.   When you see the Google Authenticator page, touch your U2F device to the back of the phone. It will authenticate and sign you into your account.     Using two-factor authentication with the API With 2FA enabled, you'll need to pass along a special header containing your 2FA authentication code. For more information, see \"Other authentication methods\" in the GitHub Developer documentation.  Using two-factor authentication with GitHub Desktop For information on accessing GitHub Desktop with two-factor authentication, see \"Authenticating to GitHub\" in the GitHub Desktop documentation.  Using two-factor authentication with the command line After you've enabled 2FA, you must use a personal access token or SSH key instead of your password when accessing GitHub on the command line.  Authenticating on the command line using HTTPS After you've enabled 2FA, you must create a personal access token to use as a password when authenticating to GitHub on the command line using HTTPS URLs. When prompted for a username and password on the command line, use your GitHub username and personal access token. The command line prompt won't specify that you should enter your personal access token when it asks for your password. For more information, see \"Creating a personal access token for the command line.\"  Authenticating on the command line using SSH Enabling 2FA doesn't change how you authenticate to GitHub on the command line using SSH URLs. For more information about setting up and using an SSH key, see \"Connecting to GitHub with SSH.\"  Using two-factor authentication to access a repository using Subversion When you access a repository via Subversion, you must provide a personal access token instead of entering your password. For more information, see \"Creating a personal access token for the command line.\"  Troubleshooting If you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials, you can use your recovery codes or another recovery method (if you've set one up) to regain access to your account. For more information, see \"Recovering your account if you lose your 2FA credentials.\" If your authentication fails several times, you may wish to synchronize your phone's clock with your mobile provider. Often, this involves checking the \"Set automatically\" option on your phone's clock, rather than providing your own time zone.

With 2FA, you have to log in with your username and password and provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to.  Configuring two-factor authentication  You can configure two-factor authentication using a mobile app or via text message. You can also add a security key using FIDO U2F.  Configuring two-factor authentication recovery methods  You can set up a variety of recovery methods to access your account if you lose your two-factor authentication credentials.  Accessing GitHub using two-factor authentication  With 2FA enabled, you'll be asked to provide your 2FA authentication code, as well as your password, when you sign in or authenticate to GitHub.  Recovering your account if you lose your 2FA credentials  If you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials, you can use your recovery codes, or another recovery option if you've set one up, to regain access to your account.  Changing two-factor authentication delivery methods for your mobile device  You can switch between receiving authentication codes through a text message or a mobile application.

Troubleshooting _config.yml syntax errors  Tip: We strongly recommend running Jekyll locally so you can easily debug and fix build errors before pushing to GitHub. To learn more about troubleshooting options, see \"Troubleshooting GitHub Pages builds.\"  Check your _config.yml file at the line referenced in the build failure email. Ensure that:  You are using spaces instead of tabs in the file. You have included a space after the \":\" for each key/value pair.  Correct example: timezone: Africa/Nairobi  Build fail example: timezone:Africa/Nairobi. You are only using UTF-8 characters. You quote any special characters.  Correct example: title: \"my awesome site: an adventure in parse errors\"  Build fail example: title: my awesome site: an adventure in parse errors   Use a YAML linter, such as http://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator, to validate your YAML code. If you run into parse errors with your _config.yml file, try copying and pasting the contents of the file into such a tool for more details. Once you've fixed any syntax errors in your _config.yml file, you will need to commit your changes and push to your GitHub Pages repository again to trigger another build on our servers.  Fixing highlighting errors If you attempt to use a syntax highlighter other than Rouge on your GitHub Pages site with Jekyll, you'll receive a page build warning. GitHub Pages does not support other highlighters and will automatically use the default Rouge. For more information, see \"Using syntax highlighting on GitHub Pages.\" To fix page build warnings, you must change your highlighter value to rouge in your _config.yml file.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. In your repository, browse to _config.yml. In the upper right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.   Find the line that starts with highlighter: and change the value to rouge.   At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see \"Creating a commit with multiple co-authors.\"  Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.  Click Propose file change.

For more information, see \"Creating a pull request.\"  In this article:  Diff view options Three-dot and two-dot Git diff comparisons Reasons diffs will not display  You can view proposed changes in a pull request in the Files changed tab.  Rather than viewing the commits themselves, you can view the proposed changes as they'll appear in the files once the pull request is merged. The files appear in alphabetical order within the Files changed tab. Additions to the files appear in green and are prefaced by a + sign while content that has been removed appears in red and is prefaced by a - sign.  Diff view options  Tip: If you're having a hard time understanding the context of a change, you can click View in the Files changed tab to view the whole file with the proposed changes.  You have several options for viewing a diff:  The unified view shows updated and existing content together in a linear view. The split view shows old content on one side and new content on the other side. The rich diff view shows a preview of how the changes will look once the pull request is merged. The source view shows the changes in source without the formatting of the rich diff view.  You can also choose to ignore whitespace changes to get a more accurate view of the substantial changes in a pull request.  To simplify reviewing changes in a large pull request, you can filter the diff to only show selected file types or to hide deleted files. For more information, see \"Filtering files in a pull request by file type.\"   Three-dot and two-dot Git diff comparisons By default, pull requests on GitHub show a three-dot diff, or a comparison between the most recent version of the topic branch and the commit where the topic branch was last synced with the base branch. To see two committish references in a two-dot diff comparison on GitHub, you can edit the URL of your repository's \"Comparing changes\" page. For more information, see the Git Glossary for \"committish\" from the Pro Git book site. For example, this URL uses the shortened seven-character SHA codes to compare commits c3a414e and faf7c6f: https://github.com/github/linguist/compare/c3a414e..faf7c6f. A two-dot diff compares two Git committish references, such as SHAs or OIDs (Object IDs), directly with each other. On GitHub, the Git committish references in a two-dot diff comparison must be pushed to the same repository or its forks. If you want to simulate a two-dot diff in a pull request and see a comparison between the most recent versions of each branch, you can merge the base branch into your topic branch, which updates the last common ancestor between your branches. For more information about Git commands to compare changes, see \"Git diff options \" from the Pro Git book site.  Reasons diffs will not display  You've exceeded the total limit of files or certain file types. For more information, see \"Limits for viewing content and diffs in a repository.\" Your file matches a rule in the repository's .gitattributes file to block that file from displaying by default.

We'll go in-depth on these commands below.  Clone To grab a complete copy of another user's repository, use git clone like this:  git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git # Clones a repository to your computer  You can choose from several different URLs when cloning a repository. While logged in to GitHub, these URLs are available below the repository details:  When you run git clone, the following actions occur:  A new folder called repo is made It is initialized as a Git repository A remote named origin is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there The default branch (usually called master) is checked out  For every branch foo in the remote repository, a corresponding remote-tracking branch refs/remotes/origin/foo is created in your local repository. You can usually abbreviate such remote-tracking branch names to origin/foo.  Fetch Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches. If you already have a local repository with a remote URL set up for the desired project, you can grab all the new information by using git fetch *remotename* in the terminal:  git fetch remotename # Fetches updates made to a remote repository  Otherwise, you can always add a new remote and then fetch.  Merge Merging combines your local changes with changes made by others. Typically, you'd merge a remote-tracking branch (i.e., a branch fetched from a remote repository) with your local branch:  git merge remotename/branchname # Merges updates made online with your local work   Pull git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git mergein the same command:  git pull remotename branchname # Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work  Because pull performs a merge on the retrieved changes, you should ensure that your local work is committed before running the pull command. If you run into a merge conflict you cannot resolve, or if you decide to quit the merge, you can use git merge --abort to take the branch back to where it was in before you pulled.

That is, the history for a single file may omit commits found on the repository's commit history. In essence, Git has several different ways of showing the history of a repository. When Git shows the history of a single file, it \"simplifies\" history by omitting commits that did not change the file. But rather than look at every commit to decide whether it touched the file, git will omit a whole branch if that branch, when merged, did not impact the final contents of the file. Any commits on that branch that touched the file will not be shown. For a file's commit history, GitHub explicitly follows this simple strategy, for two reasons:  It makes the history simpler by removing commits that did not actually contribute to the final result ( e.g., if a side branch made a change and then reverted it, or if a side branch contains a messy version of some changes that were cherry-picked and cleaned up) It's significantly more efficient to compute, as we can avoid looking at whole side-branches of the history that did not impact the file  Of course, this truncated view might not always contain the information you're after. Sometimes, you do want to know about failed experiments, or messy history, or even be finding out what went wrong in a questionable merge. As mentioned above, Git does have many ways of viewing history, and GitHub provides a view with more information on a repository's commits page.

Most often, connection problems occur because a firewall, proxy server, corporate network, or other network is configured in a way that blocks GitHub.  Whitelisting GitHub's IP addresses Make sure your network is configured to whitelist GitHub's IP addresses. For more information, see \"About GitHub's IP addresses.\"  Using a company or organization's network If you're having connectivity problems on your company or organization's network, check with your network administrator to find out if the network has rules in place to block certain traffic. If there are rules in place, ask your network administrator to whitelist traffic to GitHub.  Troubleshooting the captcha If you're unable to verify with the captcha:  Ensure javascript is enabled on your browser. Ensure your browser is supported. If your browser isn't supported, upgrade your browser or install a supported browser.

You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder cards within a column, move cards from column to column, and change the order of columns. Project board cards contain relevant metadata for issues and pull requests, like labels, assignees, the status, and who opened it. You can view and make lightweight edits to issues and pull requests within your project board by clicking on the issue or pull request's title. You can create notes within columns to serve as task reminders, references to issues and pull requests from any repository on GitHub, or to add information related to the project board. You can create a reference card for another project board by adding a link to a note. If the note isn't sufficient for your needs, you can convert it to an issue. For more information on converting project board notes to issues, see \"Adding notes to a project board.\" There are two types of project boards:   Repository project boards are scoped to issues and pull requests within a single repository. They can also include notes that reference issues and pull requests in other repositories.  Organization-wide project boards can contain issues and pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization. You can link up to five repositories to your organization project board to make it easier to add issues and pull requests from those repositories to your project board. For more information, see \"Linking a repository to a project board.\"   Creating and viewing project boards To create a project board for your organization, you must be an organization member. Organization owners and people with project board admin permissions can customize access to the project board. If an organization-owned project board includes issues or pull requests from a repository that you don't have permission to view, the card will be redacted. For more information, see \"Project board permissions for an organization.\" The activity view shows the project board's recent history, such as cards someone created or moved between columns. To access the activity view, click Menu and scroll down. To find specific cards on a project board or view a subset of the cards, you can filter project board cards. For more information, see \"Filtering cards on a project board.\" To simplify your workflow and keep completed tasks off your project board, you can archive cards. For more information, see \"Archiving cards on a project board.\" If you've completed all of your project board tasks or no longer need to use your project board, you can close the project board. For more information, see \"Closing a project board.\" You can also disable project boards in a repository or disable project boards in your organization, if you prefer to track your work in a different way.

Repository owners, people with admin permissions for an organization-owned repository, and organization owners can change a repository's visibility. For organization-owned repositories, if an organization owner has restricted the ability to change repository visibility to organization owners only, people with admin permissions to a public repository cannot make it private.  Making a public repository private If you're using GitHub Free, private repositories owned by a personal account may have up to three collaborators. If you have added more than three other users as repository collaborators, you'll need to reduce the number of collaborators to three or fewer before making the repository private, or upgrade to GitHub Pro. For more information, see \"Removing a collaborator from a personal repository.\" If you're using GitHub Free and change a repository's visibility from public to private, you'll lose access to features like protected branches and GitHub Pages.

      "body": " In this guide  About security vulnerabilities GitHub's security alerts for vulnerable dependencies Accessing security alerts Configuring security alerts Investigating and resolving a vulnerability in a dependency   About security vulnerabilities A vulnerability is a problem in a project's code that could be exploited to damage the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project or other projects that use its code. Depending on the severity level and the way your project uses the dependency, vulnerabilities can cause a range of problems for your project or the people who use it. You can track and resolve vulnerabilities for certain types of dependencies in your GitHub repository.  GitHub's security alerts for vulnerable dependencies GitHub tracks public vulnerabilities in packages from supported languages on MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) List. We also scan data in public commits on GitHub and use a combination of machine learning and human review to detect vulnerabilities that are not published in the CVE list. When GitHub discovers or is notified of a new vulnerability, we identify public repositories (and private repositories that have opted in to vulnerability detection) that use the affected version of the dependency and send a security alert. By default, we send security alerts to owners and people with admin access in the affected repositories. You can also enable security alerts for additional people or teams working in organization-owned repositories. For more information, see \"Managing alerts for vulnerable dependencies in your organization's repositories.\" GitHub never publicly discloses identified vulnerabilities for any repository. Each security alert includes a severity level and a link to the affected file in your project. When available, the alert will include further details about the vulnerability and a suggested fix. Security alerts created from items on the CVE list will contain a link to the CVE record, where you can read more details about the vulnerability, its CVSS scores, and its qualitative severity level. The severity level is one of four possible levels defined in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Section 2.1.2:  Low Moderate High Critical  For a list of the supported languages that GitHub can detect vulnerabilities and dependencies for, see \"Listing the packages that a repository depends on.\"  Accessing security alerts You can see all of the alerts affecting a particular project on the repository's Alerts tab or in the repository's dependency graph. For more information, see \"Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository.\" GitHub detects and alerts on vulnerable dependencies in public repositories by default. To receive security alerts for vulnerable dependencies in a private repository, an owner of or person with admin access to the repository must enable the dependency graph and vulnerability alerts in the repository. For more information, see \"Opting into or out of data use for your private repository.\"  Configuring security alerts By default, you will receive a weekly email summarizing security alerts for up to 10 of your repositories. You also can choose to receive security alerts individually by email, in a daily digest email, in your web notifications, or in the GitHub user interface. For more information, see \"Choosing the delivery method for your notifications.\"  Investigating and resolving a vulnerability in a dependency GitHub recommends keeping all dependencies up-to-date.  Note: After you learn about a vulnerable dependency in your repository, you should investigate its impact on your project and verify that the vulnerability is resolved by the version change before you update the dependency. If a safe recommended version does not exist, we recommend removing the dependency altogether in favor of a similar, safe dependency, if one is available.   Read the CVE record to learn more about the vulnerability and its severity level. Check to see how the vulnerable dependency is used in your project. If the vulnerability is in code that's actively used in your project, you should prioritize the update. For example, if your project uses a vulnerable dependency in test cases, it may have less risk than a vulnerable dependency that your project uses to directly process user input. Check the documentation for the dependency's recommended version to confirm that the recommended version resolves the vulnerability, and to confirm that the new version is backward compatible with your project. Confirm that updating the version will completely resolve the vulnerability for your project. Open a pull request to update the dependency to the recommended safe version and make any changes needed for compatibility. For more information, see \"Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository.\" Ensure that all of your project's tests pass and confirm that the functionality you're updating works correctly, then merge the pull request. For more information see, \"About status checks.\" Notify project collaborators, owners of any forks of your project, and any projects that depend on yours of the recommended version change and tell them how the previously vulnerable dependency affected your project. For more information, see \"Listing the projects that depend on a repository.\"   Note: GitHub's security features, such as security alerts, do not claim to catch all vulnerabilities. Though we are always trying to update our vulnerability database and alert you with our most up-to-date information, we will not be able to catch everything or alert you to known vulnerabilities within a guaranteed time frame. These features are not substitutes for human review of each dependency for potential vulnerabilities or any other issues, and we recommend consulting with a security service or conducting a thorough vulnerability review when necessary.

Usually, the changes are on different lines, or even in different files, which makes the merge simple for computers to understand. However, sometimes there are competing changes that Git can't resolve without your help. Often, merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. You must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub. If you have a merge conflict between the compare branch and base branch in your pull request, you can view a list of the files with conflicting changes above the Merge pull request button. The Merge pull request button is deactivated until you've resolved all conflicts between the compare branch and base branch.   Resolving merge conflicts To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge. There are a couple of different ways to resolve a merge conflict:  If your merge conflict is caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository, you can resolve it on GitHub using the conflict editor. For more information, see \"Resolving a merge conflict on GitHub.\" For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the merge conflict in a local clone of the repository and push the change to your branch on GitHub. You can use the command line or a tool like GitHub Desktop to push the change. For more information, see \"Resolving a merge conflict on the command line.\"  If you have a merge conflict on the command line, you cannot push your local changes to GitHub until you resolve the merge conflict locally on your computer.

      "body": "Any user or organization on GitHub can fork a repository. Forking a repository is similar to copying another repository, with two major differences:  You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your fork to the original repository, also known as the upstream repository. You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.  Deleting a fork does not delete the original upstream repository. In fact, you can make any changes you want to your fork--add collaborators, rename files, generate GitHub Pages--with no effect on the original. In open source projects, forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are offered back to the upstream repository for everyone to benefit from. When you make changes in your fork and open a pull request that compares your work to the upstream repository, you can give anyone with push access to the upstream repository permission to push changes to your pull request branch. This speeds up collaboration by allowing repository maintainers the ability to make commits or run tests locally to your pull request branch from a fork before merging. Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream or parent repository. For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository. This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code.

For more information, see \"About searching on GitHub.\"  Tips:  For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see \"Understanding the search syntax\". Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    Search within a user's or organization's repositories To find wiki pages from all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, use the user or org qualifier. To find wiki pages from a specific repository, use the repo qualifier.    Qualifier Example     user:USERNAME  user:defunkt matches wiki pages from repositories owned by @defunkt.   org:ORGNAME  org:github matches wikis in repositories owned by the GitHub organization.   repo:USERNAME/REPOSITORY  repo:defunkt/gibberish matches wiki pages from @defunkt's \"gibberish\" repository.     Search within a wiki page title or body text The in qualifier limits the search to the wiki page title or body text. Without the qualifier, both the title and body text are searched.    Qualifier Example     in:title  usage in:title matches wiki page titles with the word \"usage.\"   in:body  installation in:body matches wiki pages with the word \"installation\" in their main body text.     Search by last updated date The updated qualifier matches wiki pages that were last updated within the specified date range. Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.

You can request to join the limited public beta on the GitHub Actions page. You can create actions for your own use in private repositories or to share with others in public repositories. During the limited public beta, you can only configure workflows in private repositories.   In this article:  About GitHub Actions About workflows Discovering actions across GitHub Contacting support Further reading   About GitHub Actions GitHub Actions extend GitHub's open source network and principles across the software development lifecycle. You can use GitHub Actions to automate your workflow, express business or organization rules, or connect all of the services your project uses, right in your project's repository. You can write customized actions to interact with a repository in any way you'd like, including integrating with GitHub's APIs and any publicly available third-party API. Add actions to your project by referencing them in your repository's workflow. Your workflows can reference actions located in your own repository, or in any public repository on GitHub. Actions are defined in a Docker container. Actions run in an environment where they have access to the code in your repository, variables you define, and secrets you make available to the action.  About workflows Connect actions to create a workflow for your repository. Workflows run when triggered by events on GitHub. Your workflows can use any GitHub Action defined in a public repository on GitHub, in your repository, or in a published Docker container image. Two workflows can execute in your repository at the same time. Each workflow can contain up to 100 actions. People with write or admin access can create, view, and edit workflows for a repository. Two workflows can execute in your repository at the same time. Each workflow can contain up to 100 actions, including build and other meta steps. Workflows are stored in a file called .github/main.workflow. You can write workflows in a text editor or using GitHub's visual editor. For more information, see \"Creating a workflow with GitHub Actions.\" You can create actions for your own use in private repositories or to share with others in public repositories. During the limited public beta, you can only configure workflows in private repositories.

(or depending on where you live, one of its Affiliates) and applies to the following GitHub offerings, as further defined below (collectively, the \"Products\"):  GitHub Enterprise, comprised of GitHub Enterprise Server (formerly known as GitHub Enterprise or GHE) and GitHub Enterprise Cloud (formerly known as Business Cloud); The Website; Any related Support; and Any related Professional Services.  BY CLICKING THE \"I AGREE\" OR SIMILAR BUTTON OR BY USING ANY OF THE PRODUCTS, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement includes the following Sections:  SECTION A: GitHub Enterprise - General Terms and Conditions SECTION B: GitHub Enterprise - GitHub Enterprise Server Terms of Use SECTION C: GitHub Enterprise - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Terms of Service SECTION D: Data Protection Addendum (DPA) SECTION E: Security Exhibit  If you have purchased any Products from a GitHub Partner, the following Sections of this Agreement are superseded by the terms you have agreed upon with the GitHub Partner: Section A.2 (Payment); Section A.7 (Term and Termination); Section B.8 (Delivery); and Section B.9 (Verification).  SECTION A: GITHUB ENTERPRISE - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS This Section A sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your use of any of the Products.  1. Definitions \"Affiliate\" means any entity that directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with a Party where \"ownership\" or \"control\" means having more than fifty percent (50%) voting power of the controlled entity. \"Effective Date\" is the earlier of the date on which you (i) agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as described above, or (ii) first place an Order for the Products. \"Fees\" means the fees you are required to pay GitHub to (i) use the Products during the applicable Subscription Term or (ii) receive Professional Services, as such fees are reflected on an Order Form or SOW. \"GitHub Partner\" means a company authorized to resell Products under GitHub's Channel Partner Agreement. \"Order Form\" means written or electronic documentation (including a quote) that the Parties use to order the Products. The Order Form will specify the authorized scope of use for the Products, which may include: (i) license type, (ii) number and type of Seats, (iii) number of production instances, (iv) Subscription Term, or (v) other restrictions or special terms (collectively, the \"Scope of Use\"). Upon execution by the Parties (or, in the case of electronic orders, confirmation and placement of the order), each Order Form will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. \"Parties\" means, collectively, GitHub and you. Each may be referred to individually as a \"Party.\" \"Professional Services\" means training, consulting, or implementation services that GitHub provides to you pursuant to a mutually executed SOW. Services do not include Support. \"Professional Services Credits\" means the upfront payment method for purchasing Professional Services (exclusive of travel and lodging expenses) that you may use over a period of twelve (12) months (unless otherwise stated in an Order Form) for Professional Services. Any Professional Services Credits that remain unused at the end of twelve (12) months from the date of purchase (or as otherwise stated in an Order Form) are automatically cancelled and are non-refundable. \"Seats\" means the number of User accounts for GitHub Enterprise that you are authorized to create. You may only provision one Seat per User across GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For clarity, once you provision a Seat to a User, you will not be authorized to bifurcate the Seat so that one User can use a Seat on GitHub Enterprise Server while another User uses the same Seat on GitHub Enterprise Cloud. \"SOW\" means a mutually executed statement of work detailing the Professional Services GitHub will perform for you, any related Fees, and each Party's related obligations. \"Subscription Term\" means one (1) year from the applicable effective date of an Order or as stated in the Order Form.  2. Payment 2.1 Fees. You agree to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars (or Professional Services Credits, if applicable), unless otherwise specified in an Order Form or unless purchasing through an authorized third party (in which case, payment terms will be agreed upon between you and the authorized third party). You must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice that GitHub sends to you related to the applicable Order Form or SOW. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections A.3.2, A.4.1 and B.12.1. If you fail to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. You are solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement. 2.2 Professional Services Credits. If you use Professional Services Credits as the means of payment for Professional Services, then upon your receipt of an SOW, the applicable Professional Services Credits will be deducted from your Professional Services Credits balance. You are responsible for ensuring that your purchase order (\"PO\") issued to GitHub for the Professional Services reflects the pricing set forth in the SOW. If there is any difference in pricing listed in the SOW and the pricing listed in the PO, the pricing in the SOW will control. The Parties agree that SOWs payable via Professional Services Credits do not have to be signed by either Party to be valid and enforceable. Subject to the SOW, all Fees paid by you are non-refundable and all Professional Services Credits must be used within the time set forth in the Order Form or will automatically be cancelled and are non-refundable. You may not apply Professional Services Credits to travel and lodging expenses, which must be invoiced separately.  3. Professional Services 3.1 Professional Services. Upon your request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide a statement of work detailing such Professional Services. Each SOW is binding upon execution by the Parties and any Professional Services will be governed by the terms of the applicable SOW and this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement will control. GitHub will perform the Professional Services described in each SOW according to the timeframes set forth in such SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to determine which personnel is/are assigned to perform the Professional Services. GitHub may use third parties to perform the Professional Services, provided that GitHub remains responsible for all their acts and omissions. You acknowledge and agree that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services, including, among other things, software programs, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers anything to you during the course of performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with your use of the Software. 3.2 Limited Warranty. Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, GitHub warrants that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub's only obligation, and your only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub's option and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this warranty or (ii) if the breach cannot be cured, terminate the SOW and refund the unused prepaid Fees.  4. Indemnification 4.1 GitHub. (i) Obligation. Subject to Section A.5.2, GitHub will defend and indemnify you against any third-party claim brought against you, to the extent that it is based on an allegation that your authorized use (or, as applicable, possession) of the Software, the Website, or the Service infringes a worldwide copyright or U.S. patent or misappropriates a trade secret of any third party (each, a “Claim”), and pay damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) awarded by a court of final appeal attributable to such a Claim, provided that you: (i) notify GitHub in writing of any such Claim as soon as reasonably practicable; (ii) allow GitHub to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with GitHub in the defense of any such Claim and related settlement negotiations. (ii) Exclusions. GitHub’s indemnification obligation under Section A.4.1(i) will not extend to any Claim that is based on: (i) the modification or use of the Software, the Website, or the Service, other than as expressly authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation); (ii) your failure to stop using the Software, the Website, or the Service after receiving written notice to do so in order to avoid further infringement or misappropriation; (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Software, the Website, or the Service with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data not authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation) to the extent that without such combination such Claim would have been avoided; (iv) your unauthorized use of the Service; (v) (a) your Content (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations under Section A.4.2, or (b) any third-party deliverables or components contained within the Service; or (vi) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to such Claim without GitHub’s prior written consent (collectively, “Indemnity Exclusions”). (iii) Right to Ameliorate Damages. If your use of the Software, the Website, or the Service is, or in GitHub’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, subject to a Claim under Section A.4.1(i), GitHub may, in its sole option and at no charge to you (and in addition to any indemnification obligation under this Section A.4.1): (a) procure the right to continue using the Software, the Website, or the Service; (b) replace or modify the Software, the Website, or Service so that it is non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the original Software, Website, or Service; or (c) if options (a) and (b) above are not commercially practicable in GitHub’s reasonable estimation, terminate this Agreement and all licenses granted hereunder (in which event, you must immediately stop using the Software, the Website, or the Service) and GitHub will refund the unused, pre-paid Fees for the then-current Subscription Term. (iv) Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION A.4.1 SETS FORTH GITHUB’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 4.2 Customer.  (i) Obligation. Subject to Section A.5.2, you will defend and indemnify GitHub from and against any claims that may arise out of or that are based upon (i) content that you upload to the Software, the Website, or the Service; (ii) your violation of this Agreement, including your breach of confidentiality; or (iii) an Indemnity Exclusion (each, a “Customer Claim”), provided that GitHub (a) notifies you in writing of any such Customer Claim as soon as reasonably practicable; (b) allows you to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such Customer Claim (provided that GitHub will have the right to participate with counsel of its own choosing (at its own expense), and provided further that you may not settle such Customer Claim unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (c) reasonably cooperates with you in the defense of such Customer Claim, at your expense. (ii) Disputes with Other Users. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release GitHub from all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.   5. Representations and Warranties; Limitations of Liability 5.1 General Warranty. Each Party represents and warrants to the other that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement and each Order Form is entered into by an employee or agent of such Party with all necessary authority to bind such Party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 5.2 Limitations of Liability. (i) No Indirect Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GITHUB BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA) OR FOR THE COST OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT GITHUB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. (ii) Limitation of Total Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID TO GITHUB BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.  6. Confidentiality 6.1 Definition of Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means all non-public information disclosed by either Party to the others, whether in writing, orally or by other means, designated as confidential or that the receiving Party knows or reasonably should know, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information, is confidential to the disclosing Party. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the source code of the Software will be deemed to be GitHub's Confidential Information, regardless of whether it is marked as such. For the avoidance of doubt, no content posted on the Website or Service will be considered Confidential Information unless such content is stored solely in your private repositories on the Service. 6.2 Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing party; (iv) the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's Confidential Information; or (v) subject to Section C.5, is or has been stored or posted on the Website or Service and outside of your private repositories. 6.3 Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, \"Representatives\") who (i) have a need to know such information, (ii) are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section A.6, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and disclosure set forth in this Section A.6. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section A.6 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.  7. Term and Termination 7.1 Term. This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and will continue in effect until terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section A.7, subject to Section A.7.4. 7.2 Termination for Convenience.

      "body": "Thanks for signing up to participate in GitHub pre-release programs! As a trusted member of our community, your feedback on new and experimental features is important to us. In order to share these new products and services with you – many of which are still secret and in development – we’ll need you to agree to a special set of terms. Welcome to the Pre-release Program Agreement (“Agreement”). This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (“you”, \"your\") and GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”, or “us”). Be sure to read this Agreement carefully – you can only be a pre-release program participant if you accept all the terms of this Agreement. By clicking the “Register for the GitHub Pre-release Program” button, or by participating as a pre-release program participant in any way – for example, by accessing information about GitHub products or services that aren’t yet available to the general public – you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement. IF YOU’RE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE \"YOU\" WILL MEAN THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DON’T HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT CLICK THE \"REGISTER FOR THE GITHUB PRE-RELEASE PROGRAM\" BUTTON, AND YOU CAN’T BE A PRE-RELEASE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT. IF YOU’RE A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT THE PERSON CLICKING THE \"REGISTER FOR THE GITHUB PRE-RELEASE PROGRAM\" BUTTON HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND YOU TO THIS AGREEMENT.  1. GitHub.com’s Terms of Use or the GitHub Enterprise Software License Agreement Will Apply You need to have an account on GitHub.com or on a licensed instance of GitHub Enterprise in order to be a pre-release program participant. In addition to the GitHub.com Terms of Service or your applicable GitHub Enterprise License Agreement, as applicable, (the \"Generally Applicable Terms\"), by clicking the \"Register for the GitHub Pre-release Program\" button, you are also agreeing to be bound by this Agreement, such that both agreements will apply to you concurrently. In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and the Generally Applicable Terms, your Generally Applicable Terms will control, except with respect to any use of Pre-release Materials, in which case this Agreement will control.  2. Confidentiality; Access to Pre-Release Materials As a pre-release program participant, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.  You agree that any non-public information we give you, or that you may have access to as a pre-release program participant, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluation of the Pre-release Materials (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your confidential information but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party other than your employees and contractors, and then only to the extent that: (i) they need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; (ii) you make them aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (iii) you remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such employees and contractors; and (iv) we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure. You understand that unauthorized disclosure or use of our Confidential Information could cause us irreparable harm, and significant injury that may be difficult for us to quantify. Accordingly, you agree that we’ll have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to make sure you comply with this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have. If you are required by law, regulation or a valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose our Confidential Information, you may do so, but only if you notify us before you do, and do your best to limit such disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information. The obligations in this Section 2 won’t apply to information that you can prove: (i) was generally available to the public before we disclosed it to you; (ii) became generally available to the public after we disclosed it to you, through no action or inaction on your part, or on the part of your employees or contractors; (iii) you knew about before we disclosed it to you; (iv) was disclosed to you by a third party, who didn’t have any confidentiality obligations with respect to it; (v) you independently developed without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (vi) we gave you permission to disclose, in a writing signed by one of our authorized representatives. If we give you access to any software, pre-release software or related documentation or materials, which may include videos or other forms of content (“Pre-release Materials”), then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your Generally Applicable Terms, we hereby grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable right and license to use the Pre-release Materials during the term of this Agreement, solely for the Purpose. If the Pre-release Materials are accompanied by a separate license agreement, you agree that the separate license agreement (in addition to any more restrictive provisions contained in this Agreement or your Generally Applicable Terms) will apply. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Pre-release Materials to a human-perceivable form, and you promise not to modify, network, rent, lease, transmit, sell, or loan the Pre-release Materials, in whole or in part. You understand that we’re under no obligation to provide any Pre-release Materials to you, to provide you with updates, enhancements, or corrections to the Pre-release Materials, or to notify you of changes that we make to our products and services, now or in the future.  3. Term and Termination This Agreement begins on the date you click “Agree”, and continues for a period of one (1) year. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party gives written notice at least thirty (30) days before the current term expires that it wants to terminate, or one party terminates it earlier in accordance with this Section 3. Either you or GitHub may terminate this Agreement for any reason, without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without the requirement of notice, if you breach any term of this Agreement or your Generally Applicable Terms.  The rights and obligations in Sections 1, 2, and 4 through 17 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement all of the rights and licenses we granted you in this Agreement will immediately cease to exist, you will return (or, at our request, destroy) all of our Confidential Information and any copies (including electronic copies) which are in your possession or control, and you will certify in writing that you’ve complied with these requirements.  4. Warranties and Disclaimers You warrant to us that you: (i) have the authority to execute this Agreement and to perform its obligations; (ii) will make no false or misleading statements or representations regarding GitHub or our products and services; and (iii) will not take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representation, warranty, guarantee or endorsement to anyone on our behalf (including, without limitation, any of our products or services). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIALS OR INFORMATION THAT WE GIVE YOU OR THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  5. Indemnity We’ll be giving you access to lots of useful pre-release products, services, and information, such as the Pre-release Materials, and there are ways that you could use them improperly that could cause us harm. With that in mind, and since we can’t control the ways that you use what we give you, you agree that you will indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims which may arise under or out of your participation in any pre-release program; your negligence or intentional misconduct; any misrepresentations you make with respect to us, or our products or services; or your violation of any part of this Agreement.  6. Limitation of Liability IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRODUCTS LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  7. Export Control You aren’t allowed to export or re-export any of our Confidential Information, except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Confidential Information was obtained. In particular, you aren’t allowed to export or re-export our Confidential Information into any U.S. embargoed countries, to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals, or to anyone on the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List.

      "body": "There are two main types of development models with which you'd use pull requests. In the fork and pull model, anyone can fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without needing access to the source repository. The changes can be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. When you open a pull request proposing changes from your fork's branch to a branch in the source (upstream) repository, you can allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your pull request. This model is popular with open source projects as it reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.  Tip: For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.  In the shared repository model, collaborators are granted push access to a single shared repository and topic branches are created when changes need to be made. Pull requests are useful in this model as they initiate code review and general discussion about a set of changes before the changes are merged into the main development branch. This model is more prevalent with small teams and organizations collaborating on private projects.

      "body": " In this guide   About repository transfers  What's transferred with a repository? Repository transfers and organizations   Transferring a repository owned by your personal account Transferring a repository owned by your organization   About repository transfers When you transfer a repository to a new owner, they can immediately administer the repository's contents, issues, pull requests, releases, project boards, and settings. Prerequisites for repository transfers:   When the current owner initiates the transfer, the new owner will receive an email giving the option to accept or reject the transfer. If the new owner doesn't accept the transfer within one day, it won't complete. The target account must not have a repository with the same name, or a fork in the same network. The original owner of the repository is added as a collaborator on the transferred repository. Other collaborators to the transferred repository remain intact. Private forks can't be transferred.  If you transfer a private repository to a personal account using GitHub Free, the account will lose access to features like protected branches and GitHub Pages. For more information, see \"GitHub's products.\"  What's transferred with a repository? When you transfer a repository, its issues, pull requests, wiki, stars, and watchers are also transferred. If the transferred repository contains webhooks, services, or deploy keys, they will remain associated after the transfer is complete. Git information about commits, including contributions, is preserved. In addition:  If the transferred repository is a fork, then it remains associated with the upstream repository. If the transferred repository has any forks, then those forks will remain associated with the repository after the transfer is complete. If the transferred repository uses Git Large File Storage, all Git LFS objects are automatically moved. This transfer occurs in the background, so if you have a large number of Git LFS objects or if the Git LFS objects themselves are large, it may take some time for the transfer to occur. Before you transfer a repository that uses Git LFS, make sure the receiving account has enough data packs to store the Git LFS objects you'll be moving over. For more information on adding storage for personal accounts, see \"Upgrading Git Large File Storage.\" When a repository is transferred between two user accounts, issue assignments are left intact. When you transfer a repository from a user account to an organization, issues assigned to members in the organization remain intact, and all other issue assignees are cleared. Only owners in the organization are allowed to create new issue assignments. When you transfer a repository from an organization to a user account, only issues assigned to the repository's owner are kept, and all other issue assignees are removed. If the transferred repository contains a GitHub Pages site, then links to the Git repository on the Web and through Git activity are redirected. However, we don't redirect GitHub Pages associated with the repository.  All links to the previous repository location are automatically redirected to the new location. When you use git clone, git fetch, or git push on a transferred repository, these commands will redirect to the new repository location or URL. However, to avoid confusion, we strongly recommend updating any existing local clones to point to the new repository URL. You can do this by using git remote on the command line:  git remote set-url origin new_url  For more information, see \"Changing a remote's URL\".    Repository transfers and organizations To transfer repositories to an organization, you must have repository creation permissions in the receiving organization. If organization owners have disabled repository creation by organization members, only organization owners can transfer repositories out of or into the organization. Once a repository is transferred to an organization, the organization's default repository permission settings and default membership privileges will apply to the transferred repository.  Transferring a repository owned by your personal account You can transfer your repository to any user account that accepts your repository transfer. When a repository is transferred between two user accounts, the original repository owner and collaborators are automatically added as collaborators to the new repository.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings.  Under \"Danger Zone\", click Transfer.  Read the information about transferring a repository, then type the name of the user or organization you'd like to transfer ownership of the repository to.   Read the warnings about potential loss of features depending on the new owner's plan.   Type the name of the repository you'd like to transfer, then click I understand, transfer this repository.     Transferring a repository owned by your organization If you have owner permissions in an organization or admin permissions to one of its repositories, you can transfer a repository owned by your organization to your personal user account or to another organization.  Sign into your personal user account that has admin or owner permissions in the organization that owns the repository. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

As between GitHub and Developer, Developer is solely responsible for Developer Products. 2.2 Developer grants to GitHub a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to (a) host, link to, reproduce, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, test, distribute, make available, license and otherwise use the Listing; (b) reproduce, perform, display, use and access the Listing for administration and demonstration purposes in connection with the operation and marketing of the Marketplace; and (c) reproduce, display, distribute and otherwise use any Developer Brand Features furnished by Developer to GitHub under this Agreement solely for use in connection with the Marketplace and in order to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement.  2.3 In addition to the licenses granted above, GitHub may include Developer Brand Features furnished by Developer to GitHub under this Agreement in any presentations, communications, marketing materials, press releases, customer lists (including, without limitation any customer lists, posted to GitHub websites), publicity campaigns and other advertising collateral for purposes of marketing the Marketplace. If Developer discontinues the distribution of specific Products on the Marketplace, GitHub will, after a commercially reasonable period of time, cease use of the discontinued Products’ Brand Features. Nothing in this Agreement gives Developer a right to use any GitHub Brand Features. 2.4 Developer grants to each End User a non-exclusive, worldwide right or license to perform, display, and use the Products and any content contained in, accessed by or transmitted through the Products in connection with the Marketplace. Developer must include a separate end user license agreement (“EULA”) in its Products that will govern the End User’s rights to the Products in lieu of the foregoing sentence. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the applicable EULA for each Product is solely between Developer and the End User. GitHub shall not be responsible, nor have any liability whatsoever, under any EULA. 2.5 Except for the license rights granted in this Agreement, (a) Developer retains all rights in the Products; (b) each party retains all rights it has independent of this Agreement, including rights under the US Copyright Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions; and (c) each party owns all rights, title and interest in its respective Brand Features. Each party is responsible for protecting and enforcing its own respective rights and neither party has an obligation to do so on the other’s behalf.  2.6 Developer acknowledges and agrees that GitHub shall be entitled to provide Developer’s name, address and other contact details to any third party that reasonably, in GitHub’s sole determination, claims that Developer does not possess all of the necessary intellectual property rights in or to the Products.  3. RESTRICTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Notwithstanding any of the requirements set forth in Section 2, Purpose and License Grant, above, Developer acknowledges and agrees that its use of the Marketplace and participation in the Program is explicitly conditioned on Developer’s adherence to this Agreement, including without limitation, the restrictions and compliance requirements set forth in this Section 3. 3.1 Developer agrees it will protect the privacy and legal rights of all End Users. If an End User provides Developer with, or the Product otherwise collects, discloses, accesses or uses, End User names, passwords or other personal information, then the Developer must (a) inform End Users that such information will be available to the Products; and (b) provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection to End Users. Further, Developer Products may only use the information for the limited purpose for which Developer has obtained permission from End User. If Developer Products store or transmit personal or sensitive information provided by or obtained from End Users, then Developer must ensure all such activity is done so securely and must respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from GitHub or Marketplace End Users 3.2 In order to use and access the GitHub API, Developer must obtain API credentials (a “Token”) by becoming a subscriber. Developer may not share its Token with any third party, shall keep such Token and all login information secure and shall use the Token as Developer’s sole means of accessing the GitHub API. 3.3 Developer acknowledges and agrees that it will not engage in any activity with the Marketplace, including the distribution of Products, that violates Marketplace policies or that:  1.

Developer is not permitted to use the GitHub API or any Usage Data in any manner that does or could potentially undermine the security of the Service, the GitHub API, Usage Data or any other data or information stored or transmitted using the Marketplace. In addition, Developer shall not, and shall not attempt to, interfere with, modify or disable any features, functionality or security controls of the Marketplace or the GitHub API, defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent any protection mechanisms for the Marketplace or the GitHub API, or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or derive source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organizational form from the Marketplace or the GitHub API. 3.5 Developer acknowledges that Developer is solely responsible, and that GitHub has no responsibility or liability of any kind, for the content, development, operation, support or maintenance of Developer Products. Without limiting the foregoing, Developer will be solely responsible for  (i) the technical installation and operation of its Developer Products; (ii) creating and displaying information and content on, through or within its Developer Products; (iii) ensuring that its Developer Products do not violate or infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party; (iv) ensuring that Developer Products are not offensive, profane, obscene, libelous or otherwise illegal; (v) ensuring that its Developer Products do not contain or introduce malicious software into the Marketplace, the GitHub API, any Usage Data or other data stored or transmitted using the Marketplace; and (vi) ensuring that its Developer Products are not designed to or utilized for the purpose of sending commercial electronic messages to any GitHub.com users, agents or End Users without their consent.  3.6 Developer will respect and comply with the technical and policy-implemented limitations of the GitHub API and the restrictions of this Agreement in designing and implementing Developer Products. Without limiting the foregoing, Developer shall not violate any explicit rate limitations on calling or otherwise utilizing the GitHub API. 3.7 Marketplace Security Requirements Developer agrees to meet the security requirements set forth below, with regard to development, support, and distribution of the Developer Product made available via the GitHub Marketplace. 3.7.1 Developer Security Risk Assessment Prior to listing on Marketplace and thereafter, upon request, Developer will respond in writing to GitHub's standard risk assessment within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request. During the Term of the Agreement, GitHub will make no more than one (1) annual request for Developer's completion of a standard written risk assessment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub may make operational security or compliance inquires at any time with any degree of frequency. The standard annual risk assessment shall include, to the best of Developer's ability, the following:  (i) SOC 1 and/or SOC 2 audit report; (ii) 3rd party proof of PCI compliance (a certificate showing Developer's handling of credit card payments is compliant); (iii) Privacy Shield Attestation; (iv) ISO Certification or Cloud Security Alliance Self-Assessment; (v) Cloud Security Self Assessment; (vi) any information on subcontractor or vendor production datacenter(s), IaaS, PaaS, or private hosting providers, as required by GitHub based on data and services rendered; and (vii) Written responses and evidence of specific security requirements as outlined in this agreement  3.7.2 Meeting Security Requirements Developer will, for the Term of the Agreement, maintain equivalent or higher security controls over developer services as outlined in the security requirements described herein, and Developer will confirm compliance with such requirements in response to the security risk assessment described in Section 3.7.1 above. 3.7.3 Vulnerability Management Developer agrees to establish and maintain security vulnerability management processes meeting security industry standards, including but not limited to regular scanning, reporting, and patching, where patching is based on the risk rating of the vulnerability as determined by the Developer. 3.7.4 Clear escalation contacts Developer will provide an internal contact list/call tree for escalation for Security and Audit/Compliance operational functions with notifications to be sent to GitHub as follows:  (i) Security Incident notifications to be sent to security@github.com; and (ii) Risk, Audit, and Compliance Contact Information to be sent to security-GRC@github.com   3.7.5 Security Incident Response and Breach Process 3.7.5.1 Developer will maintain a Security Incident and Breach Response function capable of identifying, mitigating the effects of, and preventing the recurence of security incidents and breaches (occurrence). Upon confirmation of an incident occurrence that may put GitHub data or accounts at risk, Developer shall take all reasonable measures to mitigate the harmful effects of the occurrence. 3.7.5.2 Developer must notify GitHub of confirmed breach no later than twenty-four (24) hours after confirmation of a breach impacting GitHub data or GitHub customer data. 3.7.5.3 Developer must notify GitHub of an occurrence no later than seventy-two (72) hours after confirmation of a security incident impacting GitHub data or GitHub customers. 3.7.5.4 Notice. Notice of breach (Section 3.7.5.2) and notice of occurrence (Section 3.7.5.3) must include:  (i) the identification of the GitHub data which has been, or is reasonably believed to have been affected (used, accessed, acquired or disclosed); (ii) a description of what happened, including the date of the occurrence and the date of discovery of the occurrence, if known at time of reporting; (iii) the scope of the occurrence, including a description of the threat actors including known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and other threat intelligence data as such data becomes available; (iv) all corrective and remedial actions completed; (v) all efforts taken to mitigate the risks of further Incidents; and (vi) a description of Developer’s response to the occurrence, including steps Developer has taken to mitigate the harm caused by the occurrence.  3.7.5.5 Security Incident and Breach Notifications. For avoidance of doubt, GitHub classifies all non-public customer account, Organization and Repository information received from GitHub as confidential data. For the purpose of this Section 3.7.1, a Security Incident shall be defined as an event that may indicate that an organization's systems or data have been compromised or that measures put in place to protect them have failed, identified attempts from unauthorized sources to access systems or data, or unplanned disruption to a service or denial of a service, and a Breach shall be defined as an incident in which sensitive, protected or confidential data has potentially been viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. 3.7.5.6 Security and Breach Notifications must be sent to security@github.com. 3.7.6 Regulator Audit Should GitHub realize a regulatory audit that requires participation from Developer, Developer shall fully cooperate with requests by providing access to relevant knowledgeable personnel, documentation, infrastructure, and application software. GitHub shall ensure use of an independent 3rd party (such as regulator or regulators delegate) and that findings not relevant to GitHub are not disclosed to GitHub. Notification of such audit will be provided to Developer in a timely fashion, pending regulator notification, and in a manner that allows for appropriate personnel to be made available to assist. The third party auditor shall disclose to Developer any findings and recommended actions where allowed by regulator. Where regulators provide no advanced notice to GitHub of audit or investigation, Developer shall respond in as timely a fashion as required by regulators. 3.7.7 Notification of material service changes Developer will notify GitHub, Inc. of any material changes in services offered that impacts data protection and could result in use, transmission, or exposure of GitHub data in a manner not supported under contract.

Developer shall provide advance notice to GitHub of implementation of any material service changes. Material service changes may include, but are not limited to:  (i) Migration to, or addition of, a new third party IaaS or PaaS provider; (ii) Changes in geographic location of stored or processed data, e.g. a United States based Developer adding storage or process services in a new EU or APAC region; or (iii) Changes in OAuth authorization scope your service requests, e.g. your application moving from only read:org scope to including repo scope.  3.7.8 Notification of Acquisition Developer will notify GitHub, Inc. 90 days before any transfer of ownership by or of another company that will impact any data protection agreements. 3.7.9 GitHub Initiated Security Operations The following Section 3.7.10 does not preclude the Developer from maintaining their own appropriate operational security and/or application security practices. Developer will hold GitHub harmless for any outcome of acting on reported security intelligence, vulnerabilities and defects. 3.7.10 External Vulnerability Scanning Developer agrees to allow GitHub, at its discretion, to execute industry standard vulnerability scans of Developer’s public facing IPs. GitHub will provide any findings to Developer if deemed of sufficient risk for remediation and will track closure on material findings. 3.7.11 Private Bug Bounty GitHub may, at its discretion, establish a private Bug Bounty for the Developer through a vendor of GitHub’s choice, to facilitate reporting and tracking to closure any security defects found in the Developer’s product or service. 3.7.12 Security Intelligence Sharing GitHub may, at its discretion, choose to share security intelligence that may have an impact on GitHub customer and account security. Developer agrees to participate in such discussions to ensure the security of GitHub customer and user accounts and data. 3.8 GitHub reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if GitHub determines that Developer breached any requirement or obligation of this Section 3.  3.9 Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from developing and/or publishing applications that are similar or otherwise compete with the other party's applications.  4. TAKEDOWNS 4.1 Your Takedowns. Upon providing GitHub with thirty (30) days written notice in advance of the 1st day of the succeeding calendar month, you may remove your Listings from future distribution via Marketplace, but you must comply with this Agreement for any Listing distributed through Marketplace, including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace does not (a) affect the license rights of End Users who have previously purchased or installed your Listing or (b) change your obligation to deliver or support Listing that has been previously purchased or installed by users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will GitHub maintain on any portion of Marketplace any Listing that you have removed from Marketplace and provided written notice to GitHub that such removal was due to  (i) an allegation of infringement, or actual infringement, of any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person, (ii) an allegation of defamation or actual defamation, (iii) an allegation of violation, or actual violation, of any third party's right of publicity or privacy, or (iv) an allegation or determination that such Listing does not comply with applicable law.  If you remove a Listing from Marketplace pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1, and an End User purchased such Listing within a year before the date of takedown, GitHub is not responsible for refund(s) to the affected buyer of any amount paid by such End Customer during the year before the date of takedown for such affected Listing. 4.2 GitHub Review and Takedowns. While GitHub is not obligated to monitor the Listing or their content, GitHub may at any time review or test your Listing for compliance with this Agreement, the Marketplace program policies, and any other applicable terms, obligations, laws, or regulations. GitHub retains the right to refuse to include a Listing on Marketplace in its sole discretion. You may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for Marketplace, or as part of your continued use of Marketplace. You agree that any information you give to Marketplace will always be accurate, correct and up to date. As part of the specification for your Listing, GitHub may ask that you include in the file for your Listing information such as your name and email address. GitHub may use this information when featuring the Listing in our directory or for other uses. If GitHub is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware and determines in its sole discretion that a Listing or any portion thereof or your Brand Features  (a) violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third party; (b) violates any applicable law or is subject to an injunction; (c) is pornographic, obscene or otherwise violates GitHub's hosting policies or other terms of service as may be updated by GitHub from time to time in its sole discretion; (d) is being distributed by you improperly; (e) may create liability for GitHub or any third party; (f) is deemed by GitHub to be malicious or defective; (g) violates the terms of this Agreement or the Marketplace program policies; (h) the display of the Listing is impacting the integrity of GitHub servers (i.e., users are unable to access such content or otherwise experience difficulty); (i) is deemed by GitHub to add undue risk to Marketplace End Users’ data or impair the user experience of Marketplace or GitHub;  (j) is subject to user complaints in regards to your breach of your EULA, or (k) otherwise violates the Terms or this Agreement,  GitHub may: prevent the Listing from being made available on Marketplace; remove the Listing from Marketplace; flag, filter, or modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata); or reclassify the Listing at its sole discretion. GitHub reserves the right to suspend or bar any Listing from Marketplace at its sole discretion.  In the event that your Listing is involuntarily removed because it is defective, malicious, infringes intellectual property rights of another person, defames, violates a third party's right of publicity or privacy, or does not comply with applicable law, and an end user purchased such Listing within a year before the date of takedown:  (i) you must refund to the affected buyer all amounts paid by such End Customer during the year before the date of takedown for such affected Listing. (ii) GitHub may, at its sole discretion, withhold from your future sales the amount in subsection (i) above.  4.3 From time to time, GitHub may check for available updates to Listing, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. If you update your Listing to Marketplace, you agree that such update will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you. GitHub makes no guarantees regarding the timing of such updates. For the avoidance of doubt, updates to Listing are subject to the same terms and conditions as the Listing, including without limitation Section 4.2 of this Agreement (GitHub Review and Takedowns). 4.4 End-User Takedowns. If an End-User uses your Developer Product in a way that violates the Terms, then we have the right to suspend or terminate that End-User's access to the Developer Product without any liability to you.  5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 5.1 Developer represents and warrants that Developer has notified all users of such Developer Applications that their account data will be transmitted outside the Service and Developer terms will control the privacy, security or integrity of such account data.

PRICING AND PAYMENT TERMS 6.1 GitHub will be the merchant of record for Products purchased by End Users via Marketplace. 6.2 Prices for Marketplace Listings will be set in US Dollars (USD). Developer has complete control over setting pricing for each Listing, and once set, such pricing cannot be changed. You may retire a pricing plan for an existing Listing and add a new pricing plan for such Listing, provided that such new pricing plan shall not negatively impact existing End Users. The prices you set for Products will determine the amount of payment you will receive. GitHub will remit 75% of the sale price in USD without reduction for Taxes except for any withholding taxes that are required under applicable law. The remaining 25% of the sales price will be allotted to and retained by GitHub. At the end of each month and upon reaching a minimum value of $500 USD, GitHub will remit your share of payments. 6.3 Refund Requirements. You will be responsible for specifying the terms and conditions regarding refunds to your End Users. In no event shall GitHub be responsible for providing any support for refunds, nor shall GitHub be liable for payment of any refund. 6.4 You Support Your Product. You will be solely responsible for support and maintenance of your Products and any complaints about your Products. Your support contact information will be displayed in each application detail page and made available to users for customer support purposes. Failure to provide adequate support for your Products may result in less prominent product exposure, or in some cases removal from Marketplace or anywhere else on GitHub.com where previously purchased or downloaded Products are stored on behalf of users.   7. OWNERSHIP Subject to the limited licenses expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement transfers or assigns to a party any of the other party’s intellectual property rights in its Brand Features or other technology, and nothing in this Agreement transfers or assigns a party any of the other party’s intellectual property rights.  8.

      "body": " Warning:  If you remove a person’s access to a private repository, any of their forks of that private repository are deleted. Local clones of the private repository are retained. If a team's access to a private repository is revoked or a team with access to a private repository is deleted, and team members do not have access to the repository through another team, private forks of the repository will be deleted. You are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property. Organization owners can disable the ability to fork a specific private repository or to fork any private repository in an organization. For more information, see \"Allowing people to fork a private repository owned by your organization\" and \"Allowing people to fork private repositories in your organization.\"    Deleting a private repository When you delete a private repository, all of its private forks are also deleted.  Deleting a public repository When you delete a public repository, one of the existing public forks is chosen to be the new parent repository. All other repositories are forked off of this new parent and subsequent pull requests go to this new parent.  Private forks and permissions Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream or parent repository. For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository. This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code.  Changing a public repository to a private repository If a public repository is made private, its public forks are split off into a new network. As with deleting a public repository, one of the existing public forks is chosen to be the new parent repository and all other repositories are forked off of this new parent. Subsequent pull requests go to this new parent. In other words, a public repository's forks will remain public in their own separate repository network even after the parent repository is made private. This allows the fork owners to continue to work and collaborate without interruption. If public forks were not moved into a separate network in this way, the owners of those forks would need to get the appropriate access permissions to pull changes from and submit pull requests to the (now private) parent repository—even though they didn't need those permissions before.  Deleting the private repository If a public repository is made private and then deleted, its public forks will continue to exist in a separate network.  Changing a private repository to a public repository If a private repository is made public, each of its private forks is turned into a standalone private repository and becomes the parent of its own new repository network. Private forks are never automatically made public because they could contain sensitive commits that shouldn't be exposed publicly.  Deleting the public repository If a private repository is made public and then deleted, its private forks will continue to exist as standalone private repositories in separate networks.

You can see the overall state of the last commit to a branch on your repository's branches page or in your repository's list of pull requests. If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see \"About required status checks.\"  Types of status checks on GitHub There are two types of status checks on GitHub:  Checks Statuses  Checks are different from statuses in that they provide line annotations, more detailed messaging, and are only available for use with GitHub Apps. Organization owners and users with push access to a repository can create checks and statuses with GitHub's API. For more information, see \"Checks\" and \"Statuses\" in the GitHub Developer documentation.  Checks When checks are set up in a repository, pull requests have a Checks tab where you can view detailed build output from status checks and rerun failed checks.  When a specific line in a commit causes a check to fail, you will see details about the failure, warning, or notice next to the relevant code in the Files tab of the pull request.  You can navigate between the checks summaries for various commits in a pull request, using the commit drop-down menu under the Conversation tab.  Skipping and requesting checks for individual commits When a repository is set to automatically request checks for pushes, you can choose to skip checks for an individual commit you push. When a repository is not set to automatically request checks for pushes, you can request checks for an individual commit you push. For more information on these settings, see \"Check Suites\" in the GitHub Developer documentation. To skip or request checks for your commit, add one of the following trailer lines to the end of your commit message:   To skip checks for a commit, type your commit message and a short, meaningful description of your changes.

Clone the repository that contains the subfolder.  git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME    Change the current working directory to your cloned repository.  cd REPOSITORY-NAME    To filter out the subfolder from the rest of the files in the repository, run git filter-branch, supplying this information:   FOLDER-NAME: The folder within your project that you'd like to create a separate repository from.   Tip: Windows users should use / to delimit folders.     BRANCH-NAME: The default branch for your current project, for example, master or gh-pages.  git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter FOLDER-NAME BRANCH-NAME  # Filter the specified branch in your directory and remove empty commits Rewrite 48dc599c80e20527ed902928085e7861e6b3cbe6 (89/89) Ref 'refs/heads/BRANCH-NAME' was rewritten    The repository should now only contain the files that were in your subfolder.  Create a new repository on GitHub.  At the top of your new GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.   Tip: For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see \"Which remote URL should I use?\"    Check the existing remote name for your repository. For example, origin or upstream are two common choices.  git remote -v origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git (push)    Set up a new remote URL for your new repository using the existing remote name and the remote repository URL you copied in step 7.  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY-NAME.git    Verify that the remote URL has changed with your new repository name.  git remote -v # Verify new remote URL origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY-NAME.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY-NAME.git (push)    Push your changes to the new repository on GitHub.  git push -u origin BRANCH-NAME   ",

Email notification content includes any Markdown, @mentions, emojis, hash-links, and more, that appear in the original content on GitHub. If you only want to see the text in the email, you can configure your email client to display the plain text copy only. For more information about enabling email notifications, see \"Choosing the delivery method for your notifications.\"  Tip: If you receive both web and email notifications, you can automatically sync the read or unread status of the notification so that web notifications are automatically marked as read once you've read the corresponding email notification.

The header information in every email is consistent, so you can use it in your email client to filter or forward all GitHub notifications, or certain types of GitHub notifications. Email notifications from GitHub contain the following header information:    Header Information      From address This address will always be 'notifications@github.com'.

The second Cc email address matches the notification reason. The suffix for these notification reasons is @noreply.github.com. The possible notification reasons are:   assign: You were assigned to an issue or pull request.  author: You created an issue or pull request.  comment: You commented on an issue or pull request.  mention: You were mentioned on an issue or pull request.  push: Someone committed to a pull request you're subscribed to.  state_change: An issue or pull request you're subscribed to was either closed or opened.  team_mention: A team you belong to was mentioned on an issue or pull request.  your_activity: You opened, commented on, or closed an issue or pull request.      mailing list field This field identifies the name of the repository and its owner.

For more information, see \"GitHub's products.\"  You can enable SAML SSO in your organization without requiring all members to use it. Enabling but not enforcing SAML SSO in your organization can help smooth your organization's SAML SSO adoption. Once a majority of your organization's members use SAML SSO, you can enforce it within your organization. If you enable but don't enforce SAML SSO, organization members who choose not to use SAML SSO can still be members of the organization. For more information on enforcing SAML SSO, see \"Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization.\"  Note: Outside collaborators aren't required to have an external (SAML) identity to access an organization that uses SAML SSO.

For more information, see \"Downloading your organization's SAML single sign-on recovery codes.\"   In the \"Sign on URL\" field, type the HTTPS endpoint of your IdP for single sign-on requests. This value is available in your IdP configuration.  Optionally, in the \"Issuer\" field, type your SAML issuer's name. This verifies the authenticity of sent messages.   Under \"Public Certificate,\" paste a certificate to verify SAML responses.   Click  and then in the Signature Method and Digest Method drop-downs, choose the hashing algorithm used by your SAML issuer to verify the integrity of the requests.

Limitation of Liability Situations where either of us will be liable to the other for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement are limited. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.    Q. Release and Indemnification You are fully responsible for your and your Users' use of the service.   R. Changes to these Terms of Service We may modify this agreement, but we will give you 30 days' notice of changes that affect your rights.   S. Miscellaneous Please see this section for legal details including our choice of law.     The GitHub Corporate Terms of Service Effective date: May 25, 2018  A. Definitions Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Corporate Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at help.github.com/categories/site-policy. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. \"Customer\", “You,” and “Your” refer to the company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See Section B(7): Additional Terms). \"User\" refers to the individual who has visited or is using the Website or Service on your behalf; that accesses or uses any part of the account on your behalf; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of their functions on your behalf. All Users must be at least 13 years of age. \"Other Users\" refers to the individuals, not including your Users, who visit or use the Website or Service. “Users” and “Other Users” are collectively referred to as “All Users”. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees. An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. A \"Corporate Account\" refers to an Account created by a User on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. A Corporate Account may include an Enterprise Cloud subscription or a Team plan. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by All Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create, own, or to which you are the rights holder.   B. Account Terms Short version: User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; the creator and Users of your Account must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.  1. Account Controls.  Users. All Users retain ultimate administrative control over their User Accounts and the Content within them. GitHub’s Standard Terms of Service govern All Users’ use of GitHub, except with respect to Users' activities under this Agreement. Organizations. You have ultimate administrative control over any Organization created on your behalf and User-Generated Content posted to the repositories within those Organizations, subject to these Terms. You can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. Within the Service, you must designate one or more User Accounts as “owners” who are delegated administrative control of the Organization, but this designation does not supersede your ultimate administrative rights over the Organization. This Agreement will govern the use of your Organization.   2. Required Information You must provide a valid email address and your company’s name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you upgrade to a paid Account. Please see the section on Payment for information about paid Accounts.  3. Corporate Terms Applicability The Corporate Terms of Service Agreement applies only if you are entering into an agreement with GitHub on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. If you are entering into an agreement with GitHub as an individual, you should not sign this Agreement; please use the GitHub Terms of Service Agreement. To the extent these terms conflict with any other terms you've accepted for use of GitHub.com, these terms will govern with respect to any work you do on GitHub on behalf of Customer. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into the Agreement and bind the entity to these Terms.  4. Corporate Account Association If you would like to associate your Organization with a Corporate Account, we will do our best to confirm that association based on the information you provide to us. The more information you provide, the better able we will be to confirm that association. Information that helps us confirm a company's association with an Account includes: the name of the business included at the time of acceptance of these Terms, the payment information, and the email addresses associated with the Account. In the event that you do not provide sufficient information for us to confirm your company's association with the Account, association will be determined by the email addresses and security settings within your Account settings.  5. Corporate Account Requirements You must create a User Account before you can create a Corporate Account. We have a few simple rules for individual Accounts on GitHub:  You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine Account:  A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine Account in addition to your free User Account.   One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). You may not create an Account for the use of any User under the age of 13. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws. Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization Account may only provide access to as many User Accounts as its subscription allows. Overall, the number of Users accessing Organizations associated with your Corporate Account must not exceed the number we have authorized for your Corporate Account.   6. User Account Security You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while using GitHub. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.  You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account). You are responsible for maintaining the security of its Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.   7. Additional Terms In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.  C. Acceptable Use Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.  1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your and your Users' use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.  2. Content Restrictions You agree that under no circumstances will you or your Users upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:  is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities; is or contains sexually obscene content; is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent; is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group; contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.   3. Conduct Restrictions While using GitHub, you agree that under no circumstances, will you or your Users:  harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or Other Users; use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes; attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.   4. Services Usage Limits You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.  5. Scraping Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see Section H for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:  Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access. Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.  You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Other Users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.  6. Privacy Misuse of Other Users' Personal Information is prohibited. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of User Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any User Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which the Other User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or Other Users.  7. Excessive Bandwidth Use If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to Other Users, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.  8. User Protection You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms Other Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting All Users as a whole.  D. User-Generated Content Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.  1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or your Users post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.  2. GitHub May Remove Content We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.  3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you or your Users did not create yourselves and on your behalf, or do not own the rights to, you agree that you and your Users are responsible for any of that Content; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post. Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and Other Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless Other Users have forked it.  4. License Grant to Us We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you or those you choose to show it to; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with Other Users you choose to share it with; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video. We need these rights for both public and private repositories, because these rights are necessary for providing the Service. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.  5. License Grant to Other Users Any User-Generated Content you or your Users post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to Other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow Other Users to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that Other Users may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control). If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant Other Users of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to Other Users.  6. Contributions Under Repository License Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede. Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We're just making it explicit.  7. Moral Rights You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you or your Users upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.  E. Private Repositories Short version: You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.  1. Control of Private Repositories. Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.  2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories. GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.  3. Access. GitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:  With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge. When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems and Service.  You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:  You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.   4. Exclusions. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.  F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.  G. Intellectual Property Notice Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.  1. GitHub's Rights to Content GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.  2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.  3. License to GitHub Policies This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.  H. API Terms Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.  No Abuse or Overuse of the API Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension. You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations. You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling User Personal Information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement. GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API if you require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.  I. Additional Terms for GitHub Pages Short version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms. Each GitHub Account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for All Users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information. GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.  J. Third Party Applications Short version: You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for Other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.  1. Creating Applications If you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub's API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise (\"Developer Product\"), and make it available for Other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:  You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement. Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection.  You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content. You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub’s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy. You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.  If you list a Developer Product through GitHub Marketplace, then you must agree to the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement, prior to submitting the project to be listed.   2. Using Third-Party Applications You may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your repositories, including your private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through GitHub Marketplace. Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and often times multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your Account, or you are an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see our Privacy Statement for more information about how we share data with Developer Products.  GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk. If you buy Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern your use of GitHub Marketplace.   K. Advertising on GitHub Short version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.  1. GitHub Pages We offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.  2. GitHub Repositories GitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may not advertise in Other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.  3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.  L. Payment Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.  1. Pricing Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing (unless otherwise negotiated by both parties and stated in an order form). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.  2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes  We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date. If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately. You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.   3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds  For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months or partial years of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months or years unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.   4. Authorization By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.  5. Responsibility for Payment You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Account. Free Account are not required to provide payment information.  M. Cancellation and Termination Short version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.  1. Account Cancellation It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.  2. Upon Cancellation We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled. We will not delete Content that you have contributed to Other Users' repositories or that Other Users have forked. Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after any Account closure, suspension, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of closure, suspension, or downgrade.  3. GitHub May Terminate GitHub has the right to suspend access to all or any part of the Website or your Account at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub has the right to terminate your Account at any time, with or without cause, upon 30 days advance notice or if your Account has been suspended for more than 90 days.  4. Survival All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.  N. Communications with GitHub Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.  1. Electronic Communication Required For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.  2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.  3. No Phone Support GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.  O. Disclaimer of Warranties Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect. GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.  P. Limitation of Liability To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each party's total cumulative liability to the other party or any third party under this Agreement from all causes of action and all theories of liability will be limited to and will not exceed the fees you've actually paid us during the 24 months preceding the claim giving rise to such liability. You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from  the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content; your use or inability to use the Service; any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service; the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available; unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; any Other User interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service.  Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.  Q. Release and Indemnification  1. Customer’s Indemnification You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved. Subject to the limitations above, you agree to indemnify us and us hold harmless from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (a) promptly gives Customer written Notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding.; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit, or proceeding (provided that Customer may not settle any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (c) provides to Customer all reasonable assistance, at Customer’s expense. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes, provided that GitHub (i) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (ii) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (iii) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.  2. GitHub’s Indemnification We’ll defend or settle, at our option and expense, any third-party claim brought against you to the extent that it’s based on an allegation that GitHub’s service infringes a copyright or misappropriates a trade secret of any third party (each, a “Claim”), and, subject to Section P, above, Limitation of Liability, we’ll pay all damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of final appeal attributable to such a Claim, provided that you notify us in writing of any such Claim as soon as reasonably practicable and allow us to control, and reasonably cooperate with us in the defense of, any such Claim and related settlement negotiations. You understand that we’ll have no obligation to indemnify you for any claim (1) if the total aggregate fees received by GitHub with respect to your subscription to the services in the 12 month period immediately preceding the claim is less than US $50,000; (2) if the services are modified by any party other than GitHub, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the services are used in combination with any services, software, or equipment without prior written authorization by GitHub, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of the services; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) your Content (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in this Section Q (Release and Indemnification: Customer’s Indemnification)) or (z) any third-party deliverables or components contained with the services; or (6) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim without GitHub’s prior written consent. If your use of the services is, or in our reasonable opinion is likely to be, subject to a Claim under this Section Q, we may, at our sole option and at no charge to you (and in addition to our indemnity obligation to you in this Section Q): (i) procure for you the right to continue using the services; (ii) replace or modify the services so that they are non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the original services; or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above are not commercially practicable in our reasonable estimation, we can terminate these Terms of Service.  R.

So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website.

You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site Policy repository. We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.  S. Miscellaneous  1. Governing Law Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.  2.

These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.  4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.

Changes to These Terms. These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms, including any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.  6.

      "category_url": "/categories/searching-for-information-on-github",
      "url": "/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax",
      "body": " Query for values greater or less than another value You can use &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, and &lt;= to search for values that are greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to another value.    Query Example     &gt;n  cats stars:&gt;1000 matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have more than 1000 stars.   &gt;=n  cats topics:&gt;=5 matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have 5 or more topics.   &lt;n  cats size:&lt;10000 matches code with the word \"cats\" in files that are smaller than 10 KB.   &lt;=n  cats stars:&lt;=50 matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have 50 or fewer stars.    You can also use range queries to search for values that are greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to, another value.    Query Example     n..*  cats stars:10..* is equivalent to stars:&gt;=10 and matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have 10 or more stars.   *..n  cats stars:*..10 is equivalent to stars:&lt;=10 and matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have 10 or fewer stars.     Query for values between a range You can use the range syntax n..n to search for values within a range, where the first number n is the lowest value and the second is the highest value.    Query Example     n..n  cats stars:10..50 matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have between 10 and 50 stars.     Query for dates You can search for dates that are earlier or later than another date, or that fall within a range of dates, by using &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, and range queries. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day).    Query Example     &gt;YYYY-MM-DD  cats created:&gt;2016-04-29 matches issues with the word \"cats\" that were created after April 29, 2016.   &gt;=YYYY-MM-DD  cats created:&gt;=2017-04-01 matches issues with the word \"cats\" that were created on or after April 1, 2017.   &lt;YYYY-MM-DD  cats pushed:&lt;2012-07-05 matches code with the word \"cats\" in repositories that were pushed to before July 5, 2012.   &lt;=YYYY-MM-DD  cats created:&lt;=2012-07-04 matches issues with the word \"cats\" that were created on or before July 4, 2012.   YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD  cats pushed:2016-04-30..2016-07-04 matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that were pushed to between the end of April and July of 2016.   YYYY-MM-DD..*  cats created:2012-04-30..* matches issues created after April 30th, 2012 containing the word \"cats.\"   *..YYYY-MM-DD  cats created:*..2012-04-30 matches issues created before July 4th, 2012 containing the word \"cats.\"    You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).     Query Example     YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00  cats created:2017-01-01T01:00:00+07:00..2017-03-01T15:30:15+07:00 matches issues created between January 1, 2017 at 1 a.m. with a UTC offset of 07:00 and March 1, 2017 at 3 p.m. with a UTC offset of 07:00.   YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ  cats created:2016-03-21T14:11:00Z..2016-04-07T20:45:00Z matches issues created between March 21, 2016 at 2:11pm and April 7, 2106 at 8:45pm.     Exclude certain results You can exclude results containing a certain word, using the NOT syntax. The NOT operator can only be used for string keywords. It does not work for numerals or dates.    Query Example     NOT  hello NOT world matches repositories that have the word \"hello\" but not the word \"world.\"    Another way you can narrow down search results is to exclude certain subsets. You can prefix any search qualifier with a - to exclude all results that are matched by that qualifier.    Query Example     -QUALIFIER  cats stars:&gt;10 -language:javascript matches repositories with the word \"cats\" that have more than 10 stars but are not written in JavaScript.     mentions:defunkt -org:github matches issues mentioning @defunkt that are not in repositories in the GitHub organization     Use quotation marks for queries with whitespace If your search query contains whitespace, you will need to surround it with quotation marks. For example:   cats NOT \"hello world\" matches repositories with the word \"cats\" but not the words \"hello world.\"  build label:\"bug fix\" matches issues with the word \"build\" that have the label \"bug fix.\" ",

Organization owners and members can configure automatic workflows on an organization-wide project board. For more information, see \"Project board permissions for an organization.\" You can automate actions based on triggering events for project board columns. This eliminates some of the manual tasks in managing a project board. For example, you can configure a \"To do\" column, where any new issues or pull requests you add to a project board are automatically moved to the configured column. For more information, see \"Configuring automation for project boards.\"  You can use a project board template to create a project board with automation already configured. For more information, see \"About project boards.\" You can also copy a project board to reuse its customizations for similar projects. For more information, see \"Copying a project board.\" Project board automation can also help teams develop a shared understanding of a project board's purpose and the team's development process by creating a standard workflow for certain actions.

      "body": "These are the additional terms for GitHub Enterprise Cloud (\"Enterprise Cloud Terms\"). Any capitalized terms not defined in these Enterprise Cloud Terms will be defined in the Terms of Service or the Corporate Terms of Service. By agreeing to these Enterprise Cloud Terms, you also agree to the Terms of Service, as determined by the type of account you have. Enterprise Cloud includes an Organization account, SAML single sign-on, access provisioning, and 24/5 support with an 8-hour response time. This list of features and services is non-exhaustive and may be updated from time to time. For more information, see GitHub's pricing page.  Definitions:  Active User: means a user trying to access our Service at the time of an Outage. Customer: person or entity who has purchased Enterprise Cloud from GitHub. Eligible User: means an individual who is designated as a member of the Customer's Enterprise Cloud organization by having their individual GitHub account associated with the Customer's Enterprise Cloud account. Essential Services: means the services essential to GitHub's core version control functionality, including features and services such as creating, forking, and cloning repositories; creating, committing, and merging branches; creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests; and, web, API, and Git client interfaces to the core Git workflows. The following are examples of peripheral features and services not included: webhooks, Gists, Pages, or email notifications. Outage: means the interruption of an Essential Service that affects more than 50% of Active Users. Scheduled Downtime: means maintenance or updates to the Service (including to any servers or other hardware required to host the Service), which has been scheduled in advance, during which the Service may be down or inaccessible to Users. Service Credit: a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.   Enterprise Cloud Uptime SLA Program Benefits:  We guarantee that the service will have a quarterly Uptime percentage of 99.95%. That means GitHub's Essential Services will not be interrupted by an Outage affecting more than 50% of Active Users, for more than .05% of the quarter. If we don't meet our 99.95% quarterly Uptime guarantee, we may issue Service Credits to Customers.  How do we calculate Uptime?  Our Uptime calculation is based on the percentage of successful requests we serve through our web, API, and Git client interfaces.  What's excluded from our Uptime guarantee? Outages resulting from:  Scheduled Downtime Customer's acts, omissions, or misuse of the Services, including violations of the Terms of Service. Failures of your internet connectivity Factors outside our reasonable control, including Internet access related problems, force majeure events, and third party services or technology Your equipment, services, or other technology  What are Uptime Service Credits, how can I find out if I have them, and how can I redeem them?  If GitHub's quarterly Uptime percentage drops below our 99.95% Uptime guarantee, then Customer is entitled to receive 25 times the amount that was paid for the Outage time that exceeds the quarterly Uptime guarantee (\"Uptime Service Credit\"), which will be applied against the Customer's next bill. Uptime Service Credits are calculated at the end of each quarter, and may only be granted upon request. To find out about GitHub's Uptime percentage, you can request an Uptime report at the end of each quarter. In order to be granted Uptime Service Credits, either an account Owner or Billing Manager must send in a written request, on Customer's behalf, within 30 days of the end of each quarter. Uptime Service Credits may not be saved. After being granted an Uptime Service Credit, it will be automatically applied to Customer's next bill. Written requests should be sent to GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.  Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability: GitHub's Status Page is not connected to this Uptime SLA and is not an accurate representation of GitHub's Uptime for the purposes of calculating Uptime Service Credits. Service Credits are limited to 30 days of paid service, per quarter. Service Credits are Customer's only remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any Uptime obligations as identified in this Addendum.",

Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request  In a pull request, you can review and discuss commits, changed files, and the differences (or \"diff\") between the files in the base and compare branches.  Filtering files in a pull request by file type  To help you quickly review changes in a large pull request, you can filter changed files by file type.  Finding changed methods and functions in a pull request  You can quickly find proposed changes to a method or function in a pull request in .go, .js, .ts, .py, .php, and .rb files.  Commenting on a pull request  After you open a pull request in a repository, collaborators or team members can comment on the comparison of files between the two specified branches, or leave general comments on the project as a whole.  Viewing a pull request review  You can view all of the comments made in a single pull request review.  Incorporating feedback in your pull request  If reviewers give you feedback on a pull request, you can incorporate it manually and accept suggested changes automatically.  Approving a pull request with required reviews  If your repository requires reviews, pull requests must have a specific number of approving reviews from people with write or admin permissions in the repository before they can be merged.

Required reviews Repository administrators can require that all pull requests receive a specific number of approving reviews from people with write or admin permissions in the repository or from a designated code owner before they're merged into a protected branch. For more information, see \"About protected branches.\" When required reviews are enabled, anyone with access to the repository can approve changes in a pull request. However, you won't be able to merge your pull request until the required number of reviewers with write or admin permissions in the repository approve your pull request's changes in their review. For more information about repository permission levels, see \"Repository permission levels for an organization.\" If review is required from a designated code owner and the pull request affects code that has a designated owner, approval from that owner is required. If a person who requested changes isn't available to give an approving review, or if a pull request has changed significantly since it was reviewed, repository administrators or people with write access can dismiss a review. For more information, see \"Dismissing a pull request review.\" After all required reviewers have approved a pull request, you won't be able to merge it if there are other open pull requests with pending or rejected reviews and those pull requests have a head branch pointing to the same commit. Someone with write or admin permissions will need to approve or dismiss the blocking review on the other pull requests before you can merge.  Merging a pull request on GitHub  Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.  In the \"Pull Requests\" list, click the pull request you'd like to merge.  Depending on the merge options enabled for your repository, you can:   Merge all of the commits into the base branch by clicking Merge pull request. If the Merge pull request option is not shown, then click the merge drop down menu and select Create a merge commit.    Squash the commits into one commit by clicking the merge drop down menu, selecting Squash and merge and then clicking the Squash and merge button.    Rebase the commits individually onto the base branch by clicking the merge drop down menu, selecting Rebase and merge and then clicking the Rebase and merge button.   Note: Rebase and merge will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs. For more information, see \"About pull request merges.\"     If you clicked Merge pull request or Squash and merge in step 3, type a commit message, or accept the default message. Under the commit message box, click Confirm merge or Confirm squash and merge.   If you clicked Rebase and merge in step 3, click Confirm rebase and merge. Optionally, delete the branch. This keeps the list of branches in your repository tidy.  Pull requests are merged using the --no-ff option, except for pull requests with squashed or rebased commits, which are merged using the fast-forward option.

      "url": "/articles/github-gifts-and-entertainment-policy",
      "body": "GitHub recognizes that our business is built on positive and transparent relationships. While informal interactions and exchanges of gifts may be part of developing those relationships and may even be considered customary in some countries, we need to ensure that we’re following anti-bribery laws. We have a legal obligation to behave ethically, including by not using such interactions to create a special advantage or influence a deal.  Company policies As a reminder, our Code of Ethics states:  You must never pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, induce, accept, or authorize payment of anything else of value, to anyone—including to anyone in a position of power or authority, such as government officials, or in commercial transactions—in order to obtain or keep business, or secure any other improper advantage for GitHub or Microsoft. You also must not solicit or accept a bribe, kickback, or any other improper cash payment. ... [GitHub employees] are required to keep accurate and fair records of all transactions involving any expense made on GitHub’s behalf—for example, by keeping receipts and providing accurate descriptions of your expenses—or any other transaction involving the disposal or transfer of GitHub assets. Such actions are required by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which GitHub does business and are also simply the right thing to do.  GitHub's Code of Ethics elaborates on certain situations, including gifts, travel, and entertainment; facilitating payments; charitable donations; jobs; and working with representatives, as well as on who is considered a government official. Our Standards of Conduct prohibit:  Bribing government officials or other individuals to gain an unfair advantage, and taking bribes from anyone.  That means not only no cash or cash equivalent of any kind, but nothing of value, should be given to anyone (including civil servants, government officials, or anyone in a position of power or authority, as well as people not in any of those privileged positions) in order to influence them or taken from anyone to influence GitHub. Such activity is prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Anti-Bribery laws, both of which govern GitHub’s actions globally.  Examples of acceptable and unacceptable gifts So what does “of value” mean? Keep in mind that no gifts are acceptable for government officials (ok, maybe stickers). You should always ask them what their policies permit and prohibit. But if in doubt, please run it by Legal to make sure. For example, many U.S. congresspeople will not let you take them out for dinner and pay. As for other customers or prospective customers, certain things might seem trivial but have great value to someone else. For example, although it might not seem like a big deal to you to get your friend’s daughter hired as an intern, it might be of huge value to them. But if she is not qualified and you pull strings to make it happen, then it isn't ok. In addition, if the intention is to improperly influence, anything, however small, might be considered \"of value.\" 🙅 Here are some other things that aren't ok:  First class airfare to GitHub offices for Executive Briefings ✈️+🍾 Winery tours 🍷 Recommending a friend’s kid to a prestigious private school for admission 🎓 Tickets to Disneyland 👸, the World Cup 🥅, the Olympics 🏅 A futbol ⚽️ autographed by a famous player A contribution to a charity  🙆 Here is some stuff that is actually ok for customers or prospective customers:  Swag Economy class airfare to GitHub offices for Executive Briefings ✈️ Bleacher-type tickets to a sporting event ⚾️ A reasonably priced dinner in town 🍽 A small box of chocolates as an end of year thank you 🍫  All of the above applies to taking bribes too. So if a vendor or prospective vendor sends you something “of value,” don’t accept it—or at least run it by Legal before you do.  Process If you are planning to provide or accept an informal gift (that is not one of our promotional items like t-shirts and sticker swag), please make sure to follow the process below. Keep in mind that what's an acceptable amount can vary. For example, spending $50 on dinner might be considered a lot of money in some countries but not as much in others. So, when in doubt, ask!  Generally speaking, for any expenses exceeding $150, you'll need approval (each time) from Legal in writing. And for any gifts you receive exceeding $150, you'll need to report that (each time) to Legal in writing. (Legal is just weighing in on the bribery question. You might still need to check with Finance for other reasons.)  When you submit your expense report for reimbursement, please:  Indicate the recipient and the purpose of the gift in the notes; and Include a copy of the email approval     Consequences What happens if you don’t follow the policy and GitHub ends up paying for a prospective customer and his family to fly first class to Japan and attend the Tokyo Olympics? Or if you drop off a suitcase of Euros for a government official in a pre-arranged train station locker? FINES and JAIL. Not necessarily just for GitHub, either. You might get to spend a few years in jail, yourself, and it won’t matter if the customer ever submitted an order to GitHub after their trip to Japan or if the government official even picked up the suitcase of cash. Basically, it doesn’t matter whether you actually made a bribe. Yoda notwithstanding, it’s the trying that counts.

      "body": "To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file.  For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute. For contributors, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues. For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.  Tip: Repository maintainers can set specific guidelines for issues by creating an issue or pull request template for the repository. For more information, see \"About issue and pull request templates.\"   Adding a CONTRIBUTING file  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Above the file list, click Create new file.   Decide whether to store your contributing guidelines in your repository's root, docs, or .github directory. Then, in the filename field, type the name and extension for the file. Contributing guidelines filenames are not case sensitive, and can have an extension such as .md or .txt.   To make your contributing guidelines visible in the repository's root directory, type CONTRIBUTING. To make your contributing guidelines visible in the repository's docs directory, type docs/ to create the new directory, then CONTRIBUTING.   In the new file, add contribution guidelines. These could include:  Steps for creating good issues or pull requests. Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct. Community and behavioral expectations.   At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see \"Creating a commit with multiple co-authors.\"  Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.  Click Propose new file.    Examples of contribution guidelines If you're stumped, here are some good examples of contribution guidelines:  The Atom editor contribution guidelines. The Ruby on Rails contribution guidelines. The Open Government contribution guidelines.   Further reading  The Open Source Guides' section \"Starting an Open Source Project\" GitHub Learning Lab \"Adding a license to a repository\" ",

Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it.  The short version We only collect the information you choose to give us, and we process it with your consent, or on another legal basis; we only require the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes. If you're visiting us from the EU, please see our global privacy practices: we comply with the Privacy Shield framework and we are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). No matter where you are, where you live, or what your citizenship is, we provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location. Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!  Summary    Section What can you find there?     What information GitHub collects and why GitHub collects basic information from visitors to our website, and some personal information from our users. We only require the minimum amount of personal information necessary from you. This section gives details.   What information GitHub does not collect We don’t collect information from children under 13, and we don’t collect sensitive data.   How we share the information we collect We share information to provide the service to you, to comply with your requests, or with our vendors. We do not host advertising on GitHub and we do not sell your personal information. You can see a list of the vendors that access your personal information.   How you can access and control the information we collect We provide ways for you to access, alter, or delete your profile information. You can also contact Support for more help.   Our use of cookies and tracking We use cookies for the overall functionality of our website, and we use a small number of tracking and analytics services on a few parts of our site. We offer a page that makes this very transparent. Please see this section for more information.   How GitHub secures your information We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information on GitHub and to protect the resiliance of our servers as they host your information.   GitHub's global privacy practices GitHub complies with both the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the General Data Protection Regulation. Please see this section for more specific information.

Changes to our Privacy Statement We will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Statement 30 days in advance of any such changes becoming effective. You may also track changes in our Site Policy repository.   Contacting GitHub Please feel free to contact us if you have questions about our Privacy Statement.     GitHub Privacy Statement  What information GitHub collects and why  Information from website browsers If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not. The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  Why we collect this information We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use GitHub, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.  Information from users with accounts If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\" \"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation. User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.  Why we collect this information  We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including to provide the GitHub service, the Marketplace service, or to respond to support requests. We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitHub. We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to. We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. Please see our section on email communication for more information. We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow or contribute to. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public behavior on GitHub, such as the projects you star — to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights. We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation. We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.   Our legal basis for processing information Under certain international laws (including GDPR), GitHub is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. GitHub processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:  When you create a GitHub account, you provide your user name and an email address. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases. If you have a GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, or other paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. GitHub does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does. When you fill out the information in your user profile, you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third party website. You have the option of setting a publicly visible email address here. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private). Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access GitHub, and in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices. If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please use our Privacy contact form.   What information GitHub does not collect We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although GitHub does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository or in your public profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data. If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use GitHub without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent. We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs. Information in your repositories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Any personal information within a user's repository is the responsibility of the repository owner.  Repository contents GitHub employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security reasons, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, or to maintain the integrity of the service. Our Terms of Service provides more details. If your repository is public, anyone (including us and unaffiliated third parties) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses or passwords, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware. Please see more about User Personal Information in public repositories.  How we share the information we collect We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you purchase an integration or other Developer Product from our Marketplace, we will share your account name to allow the integrator to provide you services. Additionally, you may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an organization, the owner of the organization will have the ability to view your activity in the organization's access log. We will respect your choices. We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to (such as by buying an integration from Marketplace). We do not host advertising on GitHub. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. Any advertisements on individual GitHub Pages or in GitHub repositories are not sponsored by, or tracked by, GitHub. We do not disclose User Personal Information outside GitHub, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure. We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitHub, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of open source licenses across GitHub. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers. We do share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under Privacy Shield, we remain responsible for it. While GitHub processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our third party vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our third party vendors are, please see our page on Subprocessors. We do share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties. For example, we share the number of stars on a repository, or in the event of a security incident, we may share the number of times a particular file was accessed. We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.  Public information on GitHub Much of GitHub is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitHub and compile data as well. Your Personal Information, associated with your content, could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile and in your git commit settings. We currently set users' email address private by default, but legacy GitHub users may need to update their settings. If you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding scraping and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub users. Similarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a GitHub project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to GitHub users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information. If you have a complaint about any Personal Information on GitHub, please see our section on resolving complaints.  Third party applications You have the option of enabling or adding third party applications, known as \"Developer Products,\" to your account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your User Personal Information to third parties when you ask us to, such as by purchasing a Developer Product from the Marketplace; however, you are responsible for your use of the third party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it. You can check our API documentation to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.  GitHub applications You also have the option of adding applications from GitHub, such as our Desktop app, our Electron or Atom applications, or other account features, to your account. These applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all GitHub applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we will always collect the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.  How you can access and control the information we collect If you're already a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by updating out of date information, or by contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.  Data portability As a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you. You can clone your repositories to your desktop, for example, or you can use our Data Portability tools to download all of the data we have about you.  Data retention and deletion of data Generally, GitHub will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely. If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days. You may contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days. After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to others' repositories and comments in others' issues, will remain. However, we will delete or deidentify your personal information, including your user name and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with the ghost user.  The email address you have supplied via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you chose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history — the Git software is designed to maintain a record — but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.  Our use of cookies and tracking  Cookies GitHub uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of GitHub. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use GitHub’s services. We provide a web page on cookies and tracking that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the types of cookies they are (temporary or permanent). It also lists our third party analytics and service providers and details exactly which parts of our website we permit them to track.  Tracking and analytics We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users' use of GitHub; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. We only use these third party analytics providers on certain areas of our website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of personal information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance. We do not currently respond to your browser's Do Not Track signal, and we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track GitHub users' activity over time on GitHub. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time.  How GitHub secures your information GitHub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. GitHub enforces a written security information program. Our program:  aligns with industry recognized frameworks;  includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our users' data; is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of GitHub’s business operations; includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and complies with applicable information security related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where GitHub does business.  In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users without undue delay. Transmission of data on GitHub is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS. While our data is not encrypted at rest, we manage our own cages and racks at top-tier data centers with excellent physical and network security, and when data is stored with a third party storage provider, it is encrypted. No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more information, see our security disclosures.  GitHub's global privacy practices We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement (our subprocessors may store and process data outside the United States). However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries'. We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Statement — to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, and our Privacy Counsel also acts as our Data Protection Officer, part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws. In particular:   GitHub provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data using consent as a basis.  We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.  We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.  We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.   Cross-border data transfers For cross-border data transfers from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), GitHub adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework. You may view our entry in the Privacy Shield List. In addition to providing our users methods of unambiguous, informed consent and control over their data, we participate in and comply with the Privacy Shield framework, and we are committed to subject any Personal Information we receive from the EU and EEA to the Privacy Shield Principles. In addition, we continue to participate in the Safe Harbor Framework for Swiss data transfers to the US. Please read more about GitHub's international privacy commitments.  How we respond to compelled disclosure GitHub may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, GitHub strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances. For more information, see our Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data.  How we, and others, communicate with you We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we will respond to you via email. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through GitHub. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile. By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a user's email address, such as commit messages. We are not able to change many aspects of the Git system. If you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, you can create a private email address in your user profile. You should also update your local Git configuration to use your private email address. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you. We set current users' email address private by default, but legacy GitHub users may need to update their settings. Please see more about email addresses in commit messages here. Depending on your email settings, GitHub may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent, if you opt in to our list. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as mails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile. Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.  Resolving complaints If you have concerns about the way GitHub is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by filling out the Privacy contact form. You may also email us directly at privacy@github.com with the subject line \"Privacy Concerns.\" We will respond promptly — within 45 days at the latest. You may also contact our Data Protection Officer directly.    Our United States HQ Our EU Office     GitHub Data Protection Officer GitHub BV   88 Colin P.

If we cannot, we have selected JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider, to handle unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If we are unable to resolve your concerns after a good faith effort to address them, you may contact JAMS and submit a Privacy Shield claim. JAMS is a US-based private alternate dispute resolution provider, and we have contracted with JAMS to provide an independent recourse mechanism for any of our users for privacy concerns at no cost to you. You do not need to appear in court; you may conduct this dispute resolution process via telephone or video conference. If you are not based in the EU or EEA, but you would still like to use the JAMS arbitration process to resolve your dispute, please let us know and we will provide access to you. Additionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.  Independent arbitration Under certain limited circumstances, European Union individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please read more about Privacy Shield. Arbitration is not mandatory; it is a tool you can use if you choose to. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.  Changes to our Privacy Statement Although most changes are likely to be minor, GitHub may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. We will also update our Site Policy repository, which tracks all changes to this policy. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check our Site Policy repository frequently.

      "body": " GitHub doesn't have any set disk quotas. We try to provide abundant storage for all Git repositories, within reason. Keeping repositories small ensures that our servers are fast and downloads are quick for our users.   Tip: If you regularly push large files to GitHub, consider introducing Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) as part of your workflow. Git LFS works well with the GitHub Flow and can be used with any large file, regardless of its type. For more information, see \"Versioning large files.\"   File and repository size limitations We recommend repositories be kept under 1GB each. This limit is easy to stay within if large files are kept out of the repository. If your repository exceeds 1GB, you might receive a polite email from GitHub Support requesting that you reduce the size of the repository to bring it back down. In addition, we place a strict limit of files exceeding 100 MB in size. For more information, see \"Working with large files.\"  Note: If you add a file to a repository via a browser, the file can be no larger than 25 MB. For more information, see \"Adding a file to a repository\".   Backups Git is not adequately designed to serve as a backup tool. However, there are many solutions specifically designed for performing backups that are worth checking out, including Arq, Carbonite, Mozy and CrashPlan.  Database dumps Large SQL files do not play well with version control systems such as Git. If you are looking to provide your developers with the most recent production dataset, we recommend using Dropbox for sharing files like these among your developers. If you are looking to backup your production servers, see the Backups section above.  External dependencies Another thing that causes Git repositories to become large and bloated are external dependencies. It's best to leave these files out of the repository and use a package manager instead. Most popular languages come with package managers that can do this for you. Bundler, Node's Package Manager and Maven. They each support using a Git repository directly as well, so you don't need pre-packaged sources.  Packaged release versions We don't recommend distributing compiled code and pre-packaged releases within your repository. For more information on sharing large files, see \"Distributing large binaries.\"  Changing history of an existing repository If you already have a repository that's quite large, don't fret! You can remove large files from the repository's history to reduce its size. For more information, see \"Removing files from a repository's history.\"",

You can create a branch rule in a repository for a specific branch, all branches, or any branch that matches a naming pattern specified with the fnmatch syntax.

Qualifier Example     author:USERNAME  author:defunkt matches commits authored by @defunkt.   committer:USERNAME  committer:defunkt matches commits committed by @defunkt.    The author-name and committer-name qualifiers match commits by the name of the author or committer.    Qualifier Example     author-name:NAME  author-name:wanstrath matches commits with \"wanstrath\" in the author name.   committer-name:NAME  committer-name:wanstrath matches commits with \"wanstrath\" in the committer name.    The author-email and committer-email qualifiers match commits by the author's or committer's full email address.    Qualifier Example     author-email:EMAIL  author-email:chris@github.com matches commits authored by chris@github.com.   committer-email:EMAIL  committer-email:chris@github.com matches commits committed by chris@github.com.     Search by authored or committed date Use the author-date and committer-date qualifiers to match commits authored or committed within the specified date range. Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     author-date:YYYY-MM-DD  author-date:&lt;2016-01-01 matches commits authored before 2016-01-01.   committer-date:YYYY-MM-DD  committer-date:&gt;2016-01-01 matches commits committed after 2016-01-01.     Filter merge commits The merge qualifier filters merge commits.    Qualifier Example     merge:true  merge:true matches merge commits.   merge:false  merge:false matches non-merge commits.     Search by hash The hash qualifier matches commits with the specified SHA-1 hash.    Qualifier Example     hash:HASH  hash:124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105 matches commits with the hash 124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105.     Search by parent The parent qualifier matches commits whose parent has the specified SHA-1 hash.    Qualifier Example     parent:HASH  parent:124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105 matches children of commits with the hash 124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105.     Search by tree The tree qualifier matches commits with the specified SHA-1 git tree hash.    Qualifier Example     tree:HASH  tree:99ca967 matches commits that refer to the tree hash 99ca967.     Search within a user's or organization's repositories To search commits in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, use the user or org qualifier. To search commits in a specific repository, use the repo qualifier.    Qualifier Example     user:USERNAME  gibberish user:defunkt matches commit messages with the word \"gibberish\" in repositories owned by @defunkt.   org:ORGNAME  test org:github matches commit messages with the word \"test\" in repositories owned by @github.   repo:USERNAME/REPO  language repo:defunkt/gibberish matches commit messages with the word \"language\" in @defunkt's \"gibberish\" repository.     Filter public or private repositories The is qualifier matches public or private commits.    Qualifier Example     is:public  is:public matches public commits.   is:private  is:private matches private commits.     Further reading  \"Sorting search results\" ",

      "body": "Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. For more information, see \"About merge conflicts.\"  Tip: You can use the conflict editor on GitHub to resolve competing line change merge conflicts between branches that are part of a pull request. For more information, see \"Resolving a merge conflict on GitHub.\"   Competing line change merge conflicts To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit. For example, if you and another person both edited the file styleguide.md on the same lines in different branches of the same Git repository, you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches. You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.  cd REPOSITORY-NAME    Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. In this example, the file styleguide.md has a merge conflict.  git status # On branch branch-b # You have unmerged paths. # (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\") # # Unmerged paths: # (use \"git add ...\" to mark resolution) # # both modified: styleguide.md # no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")   Open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.  To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a. If you have questions, please &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD open an issue ======= ask your question in IRC. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-a    Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge: If you have questions, please open an issue or ask in our IRC channel if it's more urgent.    Add or stage your changes.  git add .    Commit your changes with a comment.  git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict by incorporating both suggestions.\"    You can now merge the branches on the command line or push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub and merge your changes in a pull request.  Removed file merge conflicts To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing changes to a file, where a person deletes a file in one branch and another person edits the same file, you must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit. For example, if you edited a file, such as README.md, and another person removed the same file in another branch in the same Git repository, you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches. You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe terminal.  Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.  cd REPOSITORY-NAME    Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. In this example, the file README.md has a merge conflict.  git status # On branch master # Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged, # and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively. # (use \"git pull\" to merge the remote branch into yours) # You have unmerged paths. # (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\") # # Unmerged paths: # (use \"git add/rm ...\" as appropriate to mark resolution) # # deleted by us: README.md # # no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")   Open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.  Decide if you want keep the removed file. You may want to view the latest changes made to the removed file in your text editor. To add the removed file back to your repository:  git add README.md  To remove this file from your repository:  git rm README.md README.md: needs merge rm 'README.md'    Commit your changes with a comment.  git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict by keeping README.md file.\" [branch-d 6f89e49] Merge branch 'branch-c' into branch-d    You can now merge the branches on the command line or push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub and merge your changes in a pull request.

      "url": "/articles/using-git-rebase-on-the-command-line",
      "body": " Here's a short tutorial on using git rebase on the command line.  In this example, we will cover all of the git rebase commands available, except for exec. We'll start our rebase by entering git rebase --interactive HEAD~7 on the terminal. Our favorite text editor will display the following lines: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A pick 6b2481b Patch B pick dd1475d something I want to split pick c619268 A fix for Patch B pick fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B  In this example, we're going to:  Squash the fifth commit (fa39187) into the \"Patch A\" commit (1fc6c95), using squash. Move the last commit (7b36971) up before the \"Patch B\" commit (6b2481b), and keep it as pick. Merge the \"A fix for Patch B\" commit (c619268) into the \"Patch B\" commit (6b2481b), and disregard the commit message using fixup. Split the third commit (dd1475d) into two smaller commits, using edit. Fix the commit message of the misspelled commit (4ca2acc), using reword.  Phew! This sounds like a lot of work, but by taking it one step at a time, we can easily make those changes. To start, we'll need to modify the commands in the file to look like this: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A squash fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B pick 6b2481b Patch B fixup c619268 A fix for Patch B edit dd1475d something I want to split reword 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods  We've changed each line's command from pick to the command we're interested in. Now, save and close the editor; this will start the interactive rebase. Git skips the first rebase command, pick 1fc6c95, since it doesn't need to do anything. It goes to the next command, squash fa39187. Since this operation requires your input, Git opens your text editor once again. The file it opens up looks something like this: # This is a combination of two commits. # The first commit's message is: Patch A # This is the 2nd commit message: something to add to patch A # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. # Not currently on any branch. # Changes to be committed: # (use \"git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage) # # modified: a #  This file is Git's way of saying, \"Hey, here's what I'm about to do with this squash.\" It lists the first commit's message (\"Patch A\"), and the second commit's message (\"something to add to patch A\"). If you're happy with these commit messages, you can save the file, and close the editor. Otherwise, you have the option of changing the commit message by simply changing the text. When the editor is closed, the rebase continues: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A squash fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B pick 6b2481b Patch B fixup c619268 A fix for Patch B edit dd1475d something I want to split reword 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods  Git processes the two pick commands (for pick 7b36971 and pick 6b2481b). It also processes the fixup command (fixup c619268), since it doesn't require any interaction. fixup merges the changes from c619268 into the commit before it, 6b2481b. Both changes will have the same commit message: \"Patch B\". Git gets to the edit dd1475d operation, stops, and prints the following message to the terminal:  You can amend the commit now, with git commit --amend Once you are satisfied with your changes, run git rebase --continue  At this point, you can edit any of the files in your project to make any additional changes. For each change you make, you'll need to perform a new commit, and you can do that by entering the git commit --amend command. When you're finished making all your changes, you can run git rebase --continue. Git then gets to the reword 4ca2acc command. It opens up your text editor one more time, and presents the following information: i cant' typ goods # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. # Not currently on any branch. # Changes to be committed: # (use \"git reset HEAD^1 &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage) # # modified: a #  As before, Git is showing the commit message for you to edit. You can change the text (\"i cant' typ goods\"), save the file, and close the editor. Git will finish the rebase and return you to the terminal.  Pushing rebased code to GitHub Since you've altered Git history, the usual git push origin will not work. You'll need to modify the command by \"force-pushing\" your latest changes:  git push origin master --force   Force pushing has serious implications, especially if your repository is being accessed by multiple people. At the least, your commits in pull requests might be out of order.

      "body": "You can search for repositories globally across all of GitHub, or search for repositories within a particular organization. For more information, see \"About searching on GitHub.\" To include forks in the search results, you will need to add fork:true or fork:only to your query. For more information, see \"Searching in forks.\"  Tips:  For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see \"Understanding the search syntax\". Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    In this article:  Search by repository name, description, or contents of the README file Search based on the contents of a repository Search within a user's or organization's repositories Search by repository size Search by number of forks Search by number of stars Search by when a repository was created or last updated Search by language Search by topic Search by number of topics Search by license Search by public or private repository Search based on whether a repository is a mirror Search based on whether a repository is archived Search based on number of issues with good first issue or help wanted labels   Search by repository name, description, or contents of the README file With the in qualifier you can restrict your search to the repository name, repository description, contents of the README file, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, only the repository name and description are searched.    Qualifier Example     in:name  jquery in:name matches repositories with \"jquery\" in their name.   in:description  jquery in:name,description matches repositories with \"jquery\" in their name or description.   in:readme  jquery in:readme matches repositories mentioning \"jquery\" in their README file.     Search based on the contents of a repository You can find a repository by searching for content in its README file, using the in:readme qualifier. Besides using in:readme, it's not possible to find repositories by searching for specific content within the repository. To search for a specific file or content within a repository, you can use the file finder or code-specific search qualifiers. For more information, see \"Finding files on GitHub\" and \"Searching code.\"    Qualifier Example     in:readme  octocat in:readme matches repositories mentioning \"octocat\" in their README file.     Search within a user's or organization's repositories To search in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the user or org qualifier.    Qualifier Example     user:USERNAME  user:defunkt forks:&gt;100 matches repositories from @defunkt that have more than 100 forks.   org:ORGNAME  org:github matches repositories from GitHub.     Search by repository size The size qualifier finds repositories that match a certain size (in kilobytes), using greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     size:n  size:1000 matches repositories that are 1 MB exactly.     size:&gt;=30000 matches repositories that are at least 30 MB.     size:&lt;50 matches repositories that are smaller than 50 KB.     size:50..120 matches repositories that are between 50 KB and 120 KB.     Search by number of forks The forks qualifier specifies the number of forks a repository should have, using greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     forks:n  forks:5 matches repositories with only five forks.     forks:&gt;=205 matches repositories with at least 205 forks.     forks:&lt;90 matches repositories with fewer than 90 forks.     forks:10..20 matches repositories with 10 to 20 forks.     Search by number of stars You can search repositories based on the number of stars a repository has, using greater than, less than, and range qualifiers    Qualifier Example     stars:n  stars:500 matches repositories with exactly 500 stars.     stars:10..20 matches repositories 10 to 20 stars, that are smaller than 1000 KB.     stars:&gt;=500 fork:true language:php matches repositories with the at least 500 stars, including forked ones, that are written in PHP.     Search by when a repository was created or last updated You can filter repositories based on time of creation or time of last update. For repository creation, you can use the created qualifier; to find out when a repository was last updated, you'll want to use the pushed qualifier. The pushed qualifier will return a list of repositories, sorted by the most recent commit made on any branch in the repository. Both take a date as a parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information THH:MM:SS+00:00 after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's T, followed by HH:MM:SS (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (+00:00).  Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     created:YYYY-MM-DD  webos created:&lt;2011-01-01 matches repositories with the word \"webos\" that were created before 2011.   pushed:YYYY-MM-DD  css pushed:&gt;2013-02-01 matches repositories with the word \"css\" that were pushed to after January 2013.     case pushed:&gt;=2013-03-06 fork:only matches repositories with the word \"case\" that were pushed to on or after March 6th, 2013, and that are forks.     Search by language You can search repositories based on the main language they're written in.    Qualifier Example     language:LANGUAGE  rails language:javascript matches repositories with the word \"rails\" that are written in JavaScript.     Search by topic You can find all of the repositories that are classified with a particular topic.    Qualifier Example     topic:TOPIC  topic:jekyll matches repositories that have been classified with the topic \"jekyll.\"     Search by number of topics You can search repositories by the number of topics that have been applied to them, using the topics qualifier along with greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.    Qualifier Example     topics:n  topics:5 matches repositories that have five topics.     topics:&gt;3 matches repositories that have more than three topics.     Search by license You can search repositories by their license. You must use a license keyword to filter repositories by a particular license or license family.    Qualifier Example     license:LICENSE_KEYWORD  license:apache-2.0 matches repositories that are licensed under Apache License 2.0.     Search by public or private repository You can filter your search based on whether a repository is public or private.    Qualifier Example     is:public  is:public org:github matches repositories owned by GitHub that are public.   is:private  is:private pages matches private repositories you have access to and that contain the word \"pages.\"     Search based on whether a repository is a mirror You can search repositories based on whether or not they're a mirror and are hosted elsewhere.

      "body": "Millions of developers host millions of projects on GitHub — both open and closed source — and we're honored to play a part in enabling collaboration across the community every day. Together, we all have an exciting opportunity and responsibility to make this a community we can be proud of. GitHub users worldwide bring wildly different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and range from people who created their first \"Hello World\" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub a welcoming environment for all the different voices and perspectives in our community, while maintaining a space where people are free to express themselves. We rely on our community members to communicate expectations, moderate their projects, and report abusive behavior or content. We do not actively seek out content to moderate. By outlining what we expect to see within our community, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate on GitHub, and what type of actions or content may violate our Terms of Service. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service.  Building a strong community The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We want people to work better together. Although we maintain the site, this is a community we build together, and we need your help to make it the best it can be.  Be welcoming and open-minded - Other collaborators may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new collaborators on your projects and discussions. Assume no malice - Humans make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions. Stay on topic - People use GitHub to get work done and to be more productive. Off topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions. Be clear - Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.   What if something or someone offends you? We rely on the community to let us know when an issue needs to be addressed. We do not actively monitor the site for offensive content. If you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable, here are some tools GitHub provides to help you take action immediately:  Communicate expectations - If you participate in a community that has not set their own, community-specific guidelines, encourage them to do so either in the README or CONTRIBUTING file, or in a dedicated code of conduct, by submitting a pull request. Moderate Comments - If you have write-access privileges for a repository, you can edit, delete, or hide anyone's comments on commits, pull requests, and issues. Anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. Comment authors and people with write access to a repository can delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see \"Tracking changes in a comment\" and \"Managing disruptive comments.\" Lock Conversations - If a discussion in an issue or pull request gets out of control, you can lock the conversation. Block Users - If you encounter a user who continues to demonstrate poor behavior, you can block the user from your personal account or block the user from your organization.  Of course, you can always contact us to Report Abuse if you need more help dealing with a situation.  What is not allowed? We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. Such discussions, however, are unlikely to foster fruitful dialog when ideas are silenced because community members are being shouted down or are afraid to speak up. That means you should be respectful and civil at all times, and refrain from attacking others on the basis of who they are. We do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line into the following:  Threats of violence - You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it on GitHub. In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety. Hate speech and discrimination - While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that when approached in an aggressive or insulting manner, these (and other) sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe. While there's always the potential for misunderstandings, we expect our community members to remain respectful and civil when discussing sensitive topics. Bullying and harassment - We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory. Impersonation - You may not seek to mislead others as to your identity by copying another person's avatar, posting content under their email address, using a similar username or otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of harassment. Doxxing and invasion of privacy - Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject. Sexually obscene content - Basically, don't post pornography. This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes. If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to post, feel free to reach out and ask beforehand. Active malware or exploits - Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery, such as using GitHub as a means to deliver malicious executables, or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers. Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community.   What happens if someone breaks the rules? There are a variety of actions that we may take when a user reports inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble. Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation that has been reported. We'll review each abuse report on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using these guidelines to guide our decision. Actions we may take in response to an abuse report include but are not limited to:  Content Removal Content Blocking Account Suspension Account Termination   Legal Notices We dedicate these Community Guidelines to the public domain for anyone to use, reuse, adapt, or whatever, under the terms of CC0-1.0. These are only guidelines; they do not modify our Terms of Service and are not intended to be a complete list. GitHub retains full discretion under the Terms of Service to remove any content or terminate any accounts for activity that violates our Terms on Acceptable Use. These guidelines describe when we will exercise that discretion.",

      "body": " Below are a list of some Git and GitHub specific terms we use across our sites and documentation.   Blame The \"blame\" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.  Branch A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the \"live\" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes. For more information, see \"About branches.\"  Check A check is a type of status check on GitHub. See \"Status checks.\"  Clone A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.  Collaborator A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.  Commit A commit, or \"revision\", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the \"SHA\" or \"hash\") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.  Contributor A contributor is someone who has contributed to a project by having a pull request merged but does not have collaborator access.  Dashboard Your personal dashboard is the main hub of your activity on GitHub. From your personal dashboard, you can keep track of issues and pull requests you're following or working on, navigate to your top repositories and team pages, and learn about recent activity in repositories you're watching or participating in. You can also discover new repositories, which are recommended based on users you're following and repositories you have starred. To only view activity for a specific organization, visit your organization's dashboard. For more information, see \"About your personal dashboard\" or \"About your organization dashboard.\"  Diff A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.  Fetch Fetching refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches (the code residing on your local machine).  Fork A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.  Git Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.  Issue Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.  Markdown Markdown is a simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports Markdown, and you can learn about the semantics.  Merge Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. For more information, see \"Merging a pull request.\"  Open source Open source software is software that can be freely used, modified, and shared (in both modified and unmodified form) by anyone. Today the concept of \"open source\" is often extended beyond software, to represent a philosophy of collaboration in which working materials are made available online for anyone to fork, modify, discuss, and contribute to. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.  Organizations Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features.  Private repository Private repositories are repositories that can only be viewed or contributed to by their creator and collaborators the creator specified.  Pull Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.  Pull request Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum. For more information, see \"About pull requests.\"  Push Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.  Remote This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.  Repository A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.  SSH key SSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information to your computer.  Status A status is a type of status check on GitHub. See \"Status checks.\"  Status checks Status checks are external processes, such as continuous integration builds, which run for each commit you make in a repository. For more information, see \"About status checks.\"  Team Teams are groups of organization members that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions.  Upstream When talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the \"upstream\", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the \"downstream\".  User Users are personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository.  Further reading  The Official Git Glossary Git Reference Git SCM ",

For more information, see \"About pull requests.\" You can also use a branch to publish a GitHub Pages site. For more information, see \"What is GitHub Pages?\" You must have write access to a repository to create a branch, open a pull request, or delete and restore branches in a pull request. In repositories where you have owner or admin access, you can change the default branch. For more information, see \"Access permissions on GitHub\" and \"Managing branches in your repository.\"  Working with protected branches Repository administrators can enable protections on a branch. If you're working on a branch that's protected, you won't be able to delete or force push to the branch. Repository administrators can additionally enable several other protected branch settings to enforce various workflows before a branch can be merged.  Note: If you're a repository administrator, you can merge pull requests on branches with branch protections enabled even if the pull request does not meet the requirements, unless branch protections have been set to \"Include administrators.\"  To see if your pull request can be merged, look in the merge box at the bottom of the pull request's Conversation tab. For more information, see \"About protected branches.\" When a branch is protected:  You won't be able to delete or force push to the branch. If required status checks are enabled on the branch, you won't be able to merge changes into the branch until all of the required CI tests pass.

For more information, see \"Merging a pull request.\" If required review from a code owner is enabled on a branch, and a pull request modifies code that has an owner, a code owner must approve the pull request before it can be merged.

If a commit or tag has a signature that cannot be verified, GitHub marks the commit or tag as unverified. Repository administrators can enforce required commit signing on a branch to block all commits that are not signed and verified. For more information, see \"About required commit signing.\" You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see \"Checking your commit and tag signature verification status.\" GitHub will automatically sign commits you make using the GitHub web interface using GPG. These commits will have a verified status on GitHub. You can verify the signature locally using the public key available at https://github.com/web-flow.gpg.  GPG commit signature verification You can use GPG to sign commits with a GPG key that you generate yourself. GitHub uses OpenPGP libraries to confirm that your locally signed commits and tags are cryptographically verifiable against a public key you have added to your GitHub account.
