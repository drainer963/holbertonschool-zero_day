<h2>A Guided Tour of Emacs</h2>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/splash.png">
  <img src="images/splash-small.png" alt="Emacs splash screen" /></a>
</p>

<p>The <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html">GNU
  Emacs Manual</a> calls Emacs <em>the extensible, customizable,
  self-documenting real-time display editor</em>, but this description tells
  beginners little about what Emacs is capable of. To give you an idea, here is
  a sampling of the things you can do with Emacs:</p>

<p>Beyond just being able to edit plain text files, Emacs includes special
  features to help you write in many different human languages and
  programming/markup languages:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td align="center">
 <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
   <td><a href="images/hello.png">
       <img src="images/hello-small.png"
	    alt="'Hello' in various languages" /></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="images/latex.png">
       <img src="images/latex-small.png"
	    alt="Syntax highlighting in Latex mode" /></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="images/code.png">
       <img src="images/code-small.png"
	    alt="Syntax highlighting in C mode" /></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td align="center">
    <small>(Click on any of these pictures for a larger view.)</small></td></tr>
 </table>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&hellip;as well as tools for compiling, running, and testing programs. Emacs
  integrates with GDB to provide an IDE (<tt>M-x gdb</tt>):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/gdb.png">
  <img src="images/gdb-composite.png" alt="GDB mode screenshot" /></a>
</p>

<p>Emacs can compare two files and highlight their differences (<tt>M-x
    ediff</tt>):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/ediff.png">
  <img src="images/ediff-small.png" alt="Ediff mode screenshot" /></a>
</p>

<p>Emacs is a file manager (<tt>M-x dired</tt>):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/dired.png">
  <img src="images/dired-small.png" alt="Close-up view of Dired" /></a>
</p>

<p>Emacs can read news, mail, and RSS feeds (<tt>M-x gnus</tt>):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/gnus.png">
  <img src="images/gnus-small.png" alt="Gnus screenshot" /></a>
</p>

<p>You can even play tetris in Emacs (<tt>M-x tetris</tt>):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/tetris.png">
  <img src="images/tetris-small.png" alt="Tetris screenshot" /></a>
</p>

<p>You might see now why some people consider Emacs to be not merely a text
  editor but almost a complete operating system. Some users find that they can
  do almost all of their work from within Emacs.</p>

<h2>Why Emacs?</h2>

<p>Emacs helps you be productive by providing an integrated environment for
  many different kinds of tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of the basic editing commands (and there are lots of them) are
    available no matter what you're trying to do: write code, read a manual,
    use a shell, or compose an email.</li>
  <li>All the tools Emacs provides for opening, saving, searching, and
    processing text (and more) are available to you no matter what you're
    doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>This uniformity means that working within Emacs is often easier than
  learning to use a separate program, especially when that program is liable to
  have its own set of editing capabilities and shortcuts.</p>

<p>If Emacs doesn't work the way you'd like, you can use
  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html">Emacs
  Lisp</a> (Elisp) language to customize Emacs, automate common tasks, or add
  new features. Elisp is very easy to get started with and yet remarkably
  powerful: you can use it to alter and extend almost any feature of Emacs. You
  can make Emacs whatever you want it to be by writing Elisp code; one
  testament to this is the fact that all of the features pictured above (and
  many more described later in this tour) are written in Elisp.</p>

<p>Emacs is also portable. You can use the same editor (with the same
  configuration) on many platforms, including GNU/Linux, BSD and other
  Unix derivatives, and some proprietary operating systems such as
  Microsoft Windows.</p>

<h2>Before we get started&hellip;</h2>

<p>If you install Emacs first, you can follow along with the examples presented
  here. Whenever you decide to start using Emacs, you should take the Emacs
  tutorial. It's an interactive hands-on which will familiarize you with many
  things, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Starting and exiting Emacs</li>
  <li>Basic text movement and editing commands</li>
  <li>Opening and saving files</li>
  <li>Emacs concepts: windows, frames, files, and buffers</li>
  <li>Invoking commands with keybindings and with <tt>M-x</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>To run the tutorial, start Emacs and type <tt>C-h t</tt>, that
  is, <tt>Ctrl-h</tt> followed by <tt>t</tt>.</p>

<p>All the features described in this tour work in GNU Emacs 23. Some features
  described weren't included in previous versions of Emacs but can be installed
  separately.</p>

<p>Occasionally I'll say something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Using-Region.html">
      <tt>(info "(emacs)Using Region")</tt></a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This refers to a page in the Emacs manual which you can read by following
  the link. However, you can also read such pages directly in Emacs by using
  the built-in documentation reader, called Info. To do this,
  press <tt>M-:</tt>, then type <tt>(info&nbsp;"(emacs)Using&nbsp;Region")</tt>
  followed by <tt>RET</tt>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/manual.png">
  <img src="images/manual-small.png" alt="Info mode screenshot" /></a>
</p>

<p>The Emacs manual is an excellent resource for learning about Emacs; you can
  read it from within Emacs by typing <tt>C-h r</tt>. You can
  also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html">read the
  manual on the web</a>.</p>

<p>Emacs has numerous other help features, some of which will be described
  later. You can view a list of all help features by typing <tt>C-h
  C-h</tt>.</p>

<h2>The power of text manipulation</h2>

<p>Emacs gives you a large collection of tools for manipulating text, which
  turns out to be a Swiss army knife of sorts because Emacs also has ways to
  present all kinds of information in text. Here's one example:</p>

<p><tt>M-x dired</tt> invokes <em>Dired</em>, the file manager mode, on a
  directory of your choice. Then <tt>C-x C-q</tt> (or <tt>M-x
  wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</tt>) switches to <em>Editable Dired</em>
  mode:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/wdired.png">
  <img src="images/wdired-small.png"
       alt="Close-up of a directory listing in Editable Dired mode." /></a>
</p>

<p>In this mode, changing the filenames in the right-hand column and then
  typing <tt>C-x C-s</tt> ("save") renames the indicated files. Renaming files
  is as easy as editing text. Batch renaming (e.g., renaming every file of the
  form <tt>icon_*</tt> to <tt>backup_icon_*</tt>) is as easy as performing a
  search and replace (<tt>M-x query-replace</tt> or <tt>M-%</tt>); there's no
  need to learn to use a separate batch renaming tool.</p>

<p>From within Emacs, you can interact with not just files and directories, but
  system utilities, compilers, debuggers, personal information managers, the
  web, email, chat, various other internet services, and more, and there's an
  ecosystem of third-party tools to make even more functionality accessible.
  Because of this integration, the benefits of learning to use any of Emacs'
  editing features (say, search and replace) are multiplied many times
  over.</p>

<h2>Basic editing commands</h2>

<p>One way that Emacs lets users work quickly and efficiently is by providing
  high-level commands for moving around in, and manipulating, text. There are
  commands that operate on characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs,
  pages, function definitions, whitespace, and more. You can use them anywhere
  you read or edit text: source code, web pages, shells, directory listings,
  email messages, and so on.</p>

<h3>Moving around in buffers</h3>

<p>The most basic buffer movement commands move point (the cursor) by rows
  (lines) or columns (characters):</p>

<table width="75%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td align="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <table class="commandlist" width="300">
    <tr><td><tt>C-f</tt></td><td>Forward one character</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>C-n</tt></td><td>Next line</td></tr>
   </table>
  </td>
  <td>
   <table class="commandlist" width="300">
    <tr><td><tt>C-b</tt></td><td>Back one character</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>C-p</tt></td><td>Previous line</td></tr>
   </table>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Here are some ways to move around in larger increments:</p>

<table width="75%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td align="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <table class="commandlist" width="300">
    <tr><td><tt>C-a</tt></td><td>Beginning of line</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-f</tt></td><td>Forward one word</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-a</tt></td><td>Previous sentence</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-v</tt></td><td>Previous screen</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-&lt;</tt></td><td>Beginning of buffer</td></tr>
   </table>
  </td>
  <td>
   <table class="commandlist" width="300">
    <tr><td><tt>C-e</tt></td><td>End of line</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-b</tt></td><td>Back one word</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-e</tt></td><td>Next sentence</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>C-v</tt></td><td>Next screen</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>M-&gt;</tt></td><td>End of buffer</td></tr>
   </table>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>When you get used to these keys, they're faster than their more familiar
  equivalents in other applications (Home, End, Ctrl+Left, etc.) because you
  don't have to move your hands from the touch typing position. And these keys
  are far faster than using a mouse to move around in a buffer.</p>

<p>Emacs often provides additional commands for moving around in
  context-specific ways (e.g. in source code, commands to move to the previous
  or next function definition).</p>

<p>Many of the above commands move to a location relative to your current
  position in the buffer, so you can use them repeatedly (e.g. <tt>C-p C-p
  C-p</tt> to move back three lines). You can use the <em>prefix argument</em>
  to save time: <tt>C-u</tt> followed by a number and a movement command
  repeats that command the specified number of times. You can also
  use <tt>M-[digit]</tt> instead of <tt>C-u [digit]</tt>. If you
  use <tt>C-u</tt> without specifying a digit, the default is 4. Omitting the
  digit can save time when you don't know precisely how many units you want to
  jump anyway.</p>

<table width="65%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td align="center">
<table class="commandlist" width="450">
  <tr><td><tt>C-u 3 C-p</tt></td><td>Back 3 lines</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u 10 C-f</tt></td><td>Forward 10 characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-1 M-0 C-f</tt></td><td>Forward 10 characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u C-n</tt></td><td>Forward 4 lines</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u C-u C-n</tt></td><td>Forward 16 lines</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u C-u C-u C-n</tt></td><td>Forward 64 lines</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>You can jump directly to a particular line number in a buffer:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-g g</tt></td><td>Jump to specified line</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Searching for text is a handy way to move around in a buffer. Think of
  search as just another facility for movement. When you're looking for
  something specific, you can use incremental search to take you right there
  instead of scanning by lines or pages. More about search later.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-s</tt></td><td>Incremental search forward</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-r</tt></td><td>Incremental search backward</td></tr>
</table>

<p>One other way of moving around in buffers is by using the <em>mark</em>:</p>

<h3>Mark</h3>

<p>Emacs remembers something called the <em>mark</em>, which is a previous
  cursor position. You can set mark to indicate a particular place in your
  buffer so you can return to it easily. <tt>C-x C-x</tt> at a later time will
  return point to mark. Actually, that command also moves mark to where point
  formerly was; therefore, a second <tt>C-x C-x</tt> returns point to its
  original position.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-SPC</tt></td><td>Set mark to the current location</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-x C-x</tt></td><td>Swap point and mark</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can set mark explicitly, but certain commands set mark for you,
  providing you with convenient footholds as you move around your buffer:</p>

<table class="greytop">
  <thead><tr><td>When you&hellip;</td><td>mark is set to&hellip;</td></tr></thead>
  <tr><td>Type <tt>C-SPC</tt></td><td>your current location</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Jump to either end of the buffer (<tt>M-&lt;</tt>
      or <tt>M-&gt;</tt>)</td><td>your previous location</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Exit incremental search</td><td>where you began searching</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Yank text</td><td>the beginning of the yanked region</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Insert a buffer or file</td>
    <td>the beginning of the inserted text</td></tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, Emacs tries to be helpful: many commands that have the
  potential to take you long distances set mark so that a simple <tt>C-x
  C-x</tt> takes you back to where you were. <em>Emacs makes it difficult to
  lose your place in a buffer</em>: even if you take a detour, you don't need
  to scroll around to get back to where you were.</p>

<p>Emacs saves many previous values of the mark for you. You can cycle through
  the <em>mark ring</em>, which contains the last 16 marks you've set in the
  current buffer:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-u C-SPC</tt></td><td>Cycle through mark ring</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Region</h3>

<p>Mark serves another purpose: mark and point together delineate <em>the
  region</em>. Many commands operate only on the text in the region (i.e.
  between mark and point). You can set the region explicitly by setting mark
  (<tt>C-SPC</tt>) and then moving point elsewhere, or by clicking and dragging
  with the mouse. Emacs provides some commands which set the region for you by
  moving point and mark appropriately, for example:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-x h</tt></td><td>Make region contain the entire buffer ("Select
      all")</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-h</tt></td><td>Make region contain the current
      paragraph</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Other commands helpfully set the region as part of what they do.
  <tt>C-y</tt> (yank), inserting a file, and inserting a buffer all set the
  region to surround the inserted text.</p>

<p><em>Narrowing</em> restricts the view (and editing) of a buffer to a certain
  region. This is handy when you're only working with a small part of a buffer
  (e.g. a chapter in a book). Then commands like incremental search,
  or <tt>beginning-of-buffer</tt> or <tt>end-of-buffer</tt> don't lead you out
  of the region of interest, and commands like search and replacement don't
  affect the entire file.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-x n n</tt></td><td>Narrow buffer to the current region</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-x n w</tt></td><td>Restore ("widen") buffer</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For more information
  see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Narrowing.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Narrowing")</tt></a>.</p>

<h3>Killing ("cutting") text</h3>

<p>As with text movement, Emacs provides commands for deleting text in various
  amounts.</p>

<p><tt>C-k</tt> kills the portion of the current line after point (or deletes
  the newline following point if point is at the end of line). The prefix
  argument for <tt>C-k</tt> can be used to kill multiple lines:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-k</tt></td><td>Kill line</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u 10 C-k</tt></td><td>Kill 10 lines</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following commands operate on the region, and are the closest analogs to
  "cut" and "copy" in Emacs:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-w</tt></td><td>Kill region ("cut")</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-w</tt></td><td>Save region to kill ring without deleting
      ("copy")</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These commands are also handy:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-d</tt></td><td>Kill next word</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-k</tt></td><td>Kill to end of sentence</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All of the above commands <em>kill</em> the text being deleted, which means
  that Emacs removes the text and squirrels it away for later retrieval
  ("yanking"). Most commands which delete significant amounts of text kill it
  rather than simply removing it, so that you can use those commands either to
  "delete" text or to "cut" it for later use.</p>

<h3>Yanking ("pasting") text</h3>

<p>After a piece of text has been killed, it goes to a place called
  the <em>kill ring</em> which is analagous to the "clipboard": you
  can <em>yank</em> an item to restore it from the kill ring with <tt>C-y</tt>.
  Unlike the clipboard, however, the kill ring is capable of holding many
  different items. If the item you want to yank is not placed when you
  type <tt>C-y</tt>, type <tt>M-y</tt> (repeatedly, if necessary) to cycle
  through previously killed items.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-y</tt></td><td>Yanks last killed text</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-y</tt></td><td>Replace yanked text with previously killed
      text</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Recall that most commands which delete a large amount of text in fact kill
  it (i.e. place it in the kill ring) so you can restore it later. <em>Emacs
  makes it very difficult to lose a lot of text permanently</em>: in editors
  with only a single clipboard, one can easily accidentally delete a large
  chunk of text or clobber the contents of the clipboard (by cutting two items
  in succession). But in Emacs, in either of those cases, the lost text can
  easily be retrieved from the kill ring.</p>

<h3>Undo</h3>

<p>Emacs' undo facility works slightly differently from that of other editors.
  In most editors, if you undo some changes, then make some new changes, the
  states formerly accessible with "redo" can no longer be recovered! So when
  using "undo" and "redo" extensively, one has to be very careful to avoid
  accidentally clobbering the redo list.</p>

<p>Emacs uses a different undo model which does not have this deficiency. After
  any consecutive sequence of undos, Emacs makes all your previous actions
  undoable, including the undos. (This will happen whenever a sequence of undos
  is broken by any other command.)</p>

<p>If this sounds complicated, just remember that "undo" is always capable of
  getting you back to <em>any previous state your buffer was in</em> (unless
  Emacs has run out of memory to store the undo history). The principle here is
  that <em>Emacs makes it very difficult to accidentally lose your work</em>.</p>

<p>Undo is available via three different keys:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-/</tt></td><td>Undo</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-_</tt></td><td>Undo</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-x u</tt></td><td>Undo</td></tr>
</table>

<p>So if you need to get back to a previous buffer state, simply move the
  cursor (so as to break any existing sequence of undos), and
  press <tt>C-/</tt> until you find what you want.</p>

<p>To learn more about undo,
  see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html">

<h3>Incremental search</h3>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-s</tt></td><td>Incremental search</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Typing <tt>C-s</tt> followed by some text starts incremental search. Emacs
  jumps to the next occurrence of whatever you have typed, as you are typing it
  (you may have seen similar behavior in Mozilla Firefox or other web
  browsers), and all matches visible on your screen are highlighted.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/isearch.png"><img src="images/isearch-small.png" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>Within incremental search, you can type <tt>C-s</tt> again at any time to
  jump to the next occurrence.</p>

<p>When you've found what you're looking for, you can either type <tt>RET</tt>
  (or use almost any movement command) to exit search at the occurrence you've
  found, or <tt>C-g</tt> ("cancel") to return to where your search started. If
  you exit search at the found occurrence, you can easily jump back to where
  you started with <tt>C-x C-x</tt> since incremental search sets mark
  appropriately.</p>

<p>These commands help you to issue previously issued queries:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-s C-s</tt></td><td>Search for most recently searched item</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-s M-p</tt></td><td>Previous item in search history</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-s M-n</tt></td><td>Next item in search history</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-h k C-s</tt></td><td>Guide to more commands available in
      incremental search</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can perform a backward incremental search with <tt>C-r</tt>. (All the
  above commands can be activated similarly from within backward search.) At
  any time during a forward (or backward) search, you can type <tt>C-r</tt>
  (<tt>C-s</tt>) to switch to a backward (forward) search.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-r</tt></td><td>Backward incremental search</td></tr>
</table>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Incremental-Search.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Incremental Search")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Search and replacement</h3>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-%</tt></td><td>Query replace</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The query replace command prompts you for a search string and a replacement.
  Then, for each match in the buffer, you can choose whether or not to replace
  the search string. Here are some of the options available at each prompt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type <tt>y</tt> to replace the current match.</li>
  <li>Type <tt>n</tt> to skip to the next match without replacing.</li>
  <li>Type <tt>q</tt> to exit without doing any more replacements.</li>
  <li>Type <tt>.</tt> to replace this match, then exit.</li>
  <li>Type <tt>!</tt> to replace all remaining matches with no more
  questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Query-Replace.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Query Replace")</tt></a> for more information about these
  (and other) options. You can also type <tt>?</tt> anytime inside a
  search-and-replace operation to see a guide.</p>

<h3>Regular expression search</h3>

<p>Emacs allows you to search for regular expressions:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-M-s</tt></td><td>Regular expression incremental
      search</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Regular expressions are a succinct way of searching for many different
  strings at once by using a special language to describe the form of what
  you're looking for. Regular expression syntax is beyond the scope of this
  tour; see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexps.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Regexps")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you're new to regexps, or you are constructing a particularly complicated
  regexp, you can use the regexp builder (<tt>M-x re-builder</tt>). This
  command pops up a separate window in which you can test out your regexp, and
  any matches in your original buffer will get highlighted as you edit your
  regexp.</p>

<p>Instead of jumping through matches one by one, you can also choose to
  display them all at once. <tt>M-x occur</tt> prompts you for a regular
  expression, then displays in a separate buffer a list of all lines in the
  current buffer which match that regexp (as well as their line numbers).
  Clicking on any occurrence takes you to that line in the buffer.</p>

<h3>Regular expression search and replacement</h3>

<p>Regular expressions are even more powerful in search and replace, because
  Emacs allows the replacement text to depend on the found text. You can
  control replacement by inserting special escape sequences in the replacement
  string, and Emacs will substitute them appropriately:</p>

<table class="greytop">
  <thead>
    <tr><td>When you type this<br />in a replacement string:</td><td>Emacs replaces it with:</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tr><td><tt>\&amp;</tt></td><td>the original found text</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>\1</tt>, <tt>\2</tt>, etc.</td><td>the 1<sup>st</sup>,
  2<sup>nd</sup>, etc. parenthesized subgroup in the found text</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>\#</tt></td><td>the number of replacements done so far</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>\?</tt></td><td>a string obtained by prompting the user on each
      match</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>\,(lisp-expression &hellip;)</tt></td><td>the result of evaluating an
      arbitrary function</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Here's an example. Suppose we have a buffer containing names like this:</p>

<pre>George Washington
John Adams
Thomas Jefferson
James Madison
James Monroe</pre>

<p>If we run <tt>M-x replace-regexp</tt> and replace the regexp <tt>\(\w+\)
    \(\w+\)</tt> with <tt>\,(upcase \2), \1</tt>, our buffer now looks like
  this:</p>

<pre>WASHINGTON, George
ADAMS, John
JEFFERSON, Thomas
MADISON, James
MONROE, James</pre>

<p>As you can see, regexp replacement is capable of doing some pretty
  sophisticated transformations. (Roughly, the search expression searches for
  two words; the replacement string inserts an uppercased version of the second
  word, followed by a comma, followed by the first word.)</p>

<h3>Keyboard Macros</h3>

<p>Keyboard macros are a way to remember a fixed sequence of keys for later
  repetition. They're handy for automating some boring editing tasks.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>F3</tt></td><td>Start recording macro</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>F4</tt></td><td>Stop recording macro</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>F4</tt></td><td>Play back macro once</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-5 F4</tt></td><td>Play back macro 5 times</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-0 F4</tt></td><td>Play back macro over and over until it fails</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For example, this sequence of keys does the exact same transformation that
  we did with regular expression replacement earlier, that is, it transforms a
  line containing <tt>George Washington</tt> to <tt>WASHINGTON, George</tt>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><tt>M-d C-d M-u , [SPC] C-y C-n C-a</tt></p>

<p>After we record that key sequence as a macro, we can type <tt>M-0 F4</tt> to
  transform the buffer pictured earlier; in this case, Emacs runs the macro
  repeatedly until it has reached the end of the buffer.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Keyboard Macros")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Help with commands</h2>

<p>If you've read this far, you are probably intimidated by the thought of
  having to remember a bunch of keyboard commands and command names.
  Fortunately, Emacs includes comprehensive and easily accessible
  documentation. The documentation isn't just for beginners. Emacs has
  thousands of commands, of which most people only use a small number. So even
  Emacs experts frequently consult the docs in order to learn about new
  commands or jog their memory on old ones.</p>

<p>If you don't remember what a particular key or command does, you can read a
  description of it by using one of the following commands:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>C-h k</tt></dt>
  <dd>Shows documentation for the command associated with any particular
    key.</dd>
  <dt><tt>C-h f</tt></dt>
  <dd>Shows documentation for any particular command, by name (i.e. what you
    would type after <tt>M-x</tt>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, <tt>C-h k C-s</tt> and <tt>C-h f isearch-forward RET</tt> both
  display a page describing incremental search:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="images/functionhelp.png"><img src="images/functionhelp-small.png" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>This is handy, for example, if you don't remember what <tt>C-s</tt> does, or
  if you remember that it invokes incremental search but want to know more
  about that feature. The documentation gives the full name of the command,
  shows which (if any) keys are bound to it, and gives a complete description
  of what the command does.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you don't remember how to invoke a particular feature,
  you can use <em>apropos</em> to search for it:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>C-h a</tt></dt>
  <dd>Search for commands by keywords or regexp</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, if I remember that I want to activate <em>narrowing</em>, but
  don't remember how, I can type <tt>C-h a narrow RET</tt> which shows a brief
  list of commands having to do with <em>narrow</em>, one of which is <tt>M-x
  narrow-to-region</tt>.</p>

<h2>More useful features</h2>

<h3>Integration with common tools</h3>

<p>Emacs is notable for its integration with many common tools. Not only can
  you invoke them from within the editor, Emacs usually helps you use their
  output more effectively. Here are some examples:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>M-x shell</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Starts a shell in the buffer named <tt>*shell*</tt>, switching to it if
    it already exists. Use <tt>C-u M-x shell</tt> to use a buffer with a
    different name.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="images/shell.png"><img src="images/shell-small.png" alt="" /></a>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x compile</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Invokes <tt>make</tt> (with targets and options of your choice) and
    displays output in a new buffer. Emacs identifies error lines containing
    filenames and line numbers, and you can click on them to jump directly to
    the corresponding buffer and line.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="images/compile.png"><img src="images/compile-small.png" alt="" /></a>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x gdb</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Invokes <tt>gdb</tt> in a new buffer. You can use the gdb command line
    as usual in that buffer. However, Emacs lets you set breakpoints directly
    from your source buffers and shows execution by marking the active line in
    your source buffers. Emacs can also display breakpoints, the stack, and
    locals, simultaneously and each in their own window.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="images/gdb.png"><img src="images/gdb-composite.png" alt="" /></a>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x grep</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Invokes <tt>grep</tt> and prints results in a new buffer. Like <tt>M-x
    compile</tt>, when you click on a match Emacs opens the correct file and
    takes you to the matching line.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="images/grep.png"><img src="images/grep-small.png" alt="" /></a>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x man</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Displays <tt>man</tt> pages.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="images/man.png"><img src="images/man-small.png" alt="" /></a>
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Here are some more assorted tools:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-x calculator</tt></td><td>A simple calculator.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x calendar</tt></td><td>A calendar.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x phases-of-moon</tt></td><td>Shows upcoming quarters of the
      moon.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Invoking shell commands</h3>

<p>If you need to execute a simple shell command, these commands can save you
  the trouble of switching to an xterm or starting a new Emacs shell
  buffer:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>M-x shell-command</tt> or <tt>M-!</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Executes a command and displays the output in a new buffer.</p></dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x shell-command-on-region</tt> or <tt>M-|</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Executes a command, piping in the current region as input; displays
    the output in a new buffer.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For either command, a <tt>C-u</tt> prefix will insert the output in your
  current buffer rather than using a temporary buffer.</p>

<h3>Version control</h3>

<p>Emacs helps you manipulate and edit files stored in version control. Emacs
  supports CVS, Subversion, bzr, git, hg, and other systems, but it offers a
  uniform interface, called VC, regardless of the version control system you
  are using.</p>

<p>Emacs automatically detects when a file you're editing is under version
  control, and displays something like this in the mode line: <tt>CVS-1.14</tt>
  to indicate the version control system in use, and the current version.</p>

<p><tt>M-x vc-next-action</tt> or <tt>C-x v v</tt> commits the current file
  (prompting you for a log message) if you've modified it. (Under version
  control systems that require locking, this command also acquires a lock for
  you.)</p>

<p>VC provides other commands for version control-related tasks:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>C-x v =</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Displays a diff showing the changes you've made to the current
      file.</p></dd>
  <dt><tt>C-x v ~</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Prompts you for a version number and shows you that version of the
      current file in another window.</p></dd>
  <dt><tt>C-x v g</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Displays an annotated version of the file showing, for each line, the
      commit where that line was last changed and by whom. On any line you can
      press <tt>L</tt> to view the log message for that commit or <tt>D</tt> to
      view the associated diff.</p></dd>
  <dt><tt>C-x v l</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Displays a log of previous changes to the file. When the cursor is on
      a particular log entry, you can press <tt>d</tt> to view the diff
      associated with that change or <tt>f</tt> to view that version of the
      file.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Version Control")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<p>Some special features are enabled when you are looking at a diff (whether
  from a file, or one produced by VC). Emacs lets you move around in a diff by
  hunks or files, apply individual hunks to a file, reverse a diff, and do
  other operations useful for reading or manually editing diffs.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diff-Mode.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Diff Mode")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Editing remote files</h3>

<p>Emacs can edit remote files transparently (as if they were local) using a
  feature called Tramp. Whenever Emacs asks for a file, you can indicate a
  remote file like so: <tt>/myname@remotehost:/remote/path/to/file</tt>. Emacs
  retrieves the file over SSH, FTP, or another method and takes care of saving
  it when you're done. With Tramp you can edit files on different computers
  using a single Emacs session, even if Emacs is not installed on the remote
  side.</p>

<p>You can also use Tramp to edit local files with another user's permissions.
  You can edit files with root privileges via sudo: <tt>/sudo::/etc/file</tt>,
  or via su: <tt>/root@localhost:/etc/file</tt>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/index.html">
    <tt>(info "(TRAMP)")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Emacs server</h3>

<p>Some people like to keep only a single instance of Emacs open and edit all
  their files in there. Doing this has a few advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can kill/yank text between buffers in the same instance of
    Emacs.</li>
  <li>Emacs remembers argument histories (what commands you've used, what files
    you've opened, terms you've searched for, etc.), but only within each
    instance.</li>
  <li>If you have many customizations, starting new instances of Emacs is
    slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, when you type <tt>emacs</tt> in a shell to edit a file (or
  when <tt>$EDITOR</tt> is invoked by an external program), a new instance of
  Emacs is started. You can avoid this by using <tt>emacsclient</tt>, which
  instead opens a new frame connected to an existing instance of Emacs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In your existing instance of Emacs, type <tt>M-x server-start</tt>. Or
    add <tt>(server-start)</tt> to your <tt>.emacs</tt> file to make it do that
    automatically at startup.</li>
  <li>To edit a file, type <tt>emacsclient&nbsp;-t&nbsp;FILENAME</tt> at a
    prompt. You can also change your <tt>$EDITOR</tt>
    to <tt>emacsclient&nbsp;-t</tt> if you're using programs that automatically
    invoke <tt>$EDITOR</tt>. (<tt>emacsclient&nbsp;-t</tt> opens a new frame on
    the terminal; alternatively, <tt>emacsclient&nbsp;-c</tt> opens a new X
    frame.)</li>
  <li>When you're done editing, type <tt>C-x C-c</tt>, which closes the
    frame.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more information,
  see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Emacs Server")</tt></a>.</p>

<h3>Being unproductive with Emacs</h3>

<p>Emacs even comes with diversions:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-x tetris</tt></td><td>Tetris</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x hanoi</tt></td><td>Towers of Hanoi game</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x doctor</tt></td><td>Emacs psychotherapist</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Common Emacs concepts</h2>

<h3>Prefix arguments</h3>

<p>As we've seen, prefix arguments are sometimes used to indicate
  repetition:</p>
<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>C-u 10 C-f</tt></td><td>Forward 10 characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u M-a</tt></td><td>Backward 4 sentences</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We've also seen a prefix argument used to modify the following command (the
  numeric argument, if provided, is ignored):</p>
<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-x shell</tt></td><td>Create or switch to shell buffer
      named <tt>*shell*</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>C-u M-x shell</tt></td><td>Create or switch to shell buffer with
      specified name</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you ever get confused, the documentation for any command (accessible
  with <tt>C-h f</tt> or <tt>C-h k</tt>) describes the effect of the prefix
  argument, if any.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Arguments.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Arguments")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Major modes</h3>

<p>Every buffer has an associated <em>major mode</em>, which alters certain
  behaviors, key bindings, and text display in that buffer. The idea is to
  customize the appearance and features available based on the contents of the
  buffer.</p>

<p>Emacs ships with dozens of major modes for editing widely used programming
  languages, markup languages, and configuration file formats. These major
  modes tell Emacs how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indent your code correctly (usually, simply pressing <tt>TAB</tt> once
    will make Emacs indent the current line correctly).</li>
  <li>Do syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Identify the boundaries of functions</li>
  <li>Invoke interpreters, compilers, or debuggers for your code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some commands we've seen, like <tt>M-x dired</tt>, <tt>M-x compile</tt>,
  and <tt>M-x shell</tt>, in fact use their own special major modes to make
  their buffers provide certain features (such as highlighting compile errors
  and making them clickable).</p>

<p>The current major mode is displayed in the mode line. The last thing on the
  mode line should be one or more items in parentheses, like <tt>(Python
  Narrow)</tt>. The first of these is the name of the major mode.</p>

<p>You can switch modes in an existing buffer by using <tt>M-x</tt> and the
  name of the mode:</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-x java-mode</tt></td><td>Mode for editing Java files</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x python-mode</tt></td><td>Mode for editing Python files</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x text-mode</tt></td><td>Mode for editing text files</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x fundamental-mode</tt></td><td>Mode with no specializations at all</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Emacs is very good at determining the right mode to use when you open a
  file, so you'll rarely have to use the above commands.</p>

<p>These are examples of the commands provided by language major modes:</p>

<table class="greytop">
  <thead>
    <tr><td>Language</td><td>Some special commands available</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tr><td>Lisp</td><td>Manipulate s-exps in various ways; execute expressions</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Python</td><td>Indent, unindent blocks; run code in Python shell</td></tr>
  <tr><td>HTML</td><td>Insert and close tags; preview in browser</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In almost all cases, major modes for unsupported formats are available as
  extension packages. You can find many of them
  on <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/">EmacsWiki</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Major-Modes.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Major Modes")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Minor modes</h3>

<p>Every buffer can also have any number of <em>minor modes</em>, which are
  extra pieces of functionality you can enable, independently of each other and
  of the major mode. Minor modes are listed in the mode line after the major
  mode inside the parentheses. Here are a few commonly used ones:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>M-x auto-fill-mode</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Wraps your lines automatically when they get longer than 70
    characters.</p></dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x flyspell-mode</tt></dt>
  <dd><p>Highlights misspelled words as you type.</p></dd>
  <dt><tt>M-x follow-mode</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you have a buffer displayed in two windows side by
    side, <tt>follow-mode</tt> forces them to scroll together such that the
    text displayed in the second window comes right after the text in the first
    window, and moving your cursor off the bottom of the left window causes it
    to appear at the top of the right window:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="images/follow.png"><img src="images/follow-small.png" alt="" /></a>
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Some minor modes are global, i.e. they affect the behavior of the entire
  editor, rather than just that of a specific buffer.</p>

<table class="commandlist">
  <tr><td><tt>M-x icomplete-mode</tt></td><td>In the M-x prompt (and
      elsewhere), show completions as you type</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>M-x iswitchb-mode</tt></td><td>Show all buffer names when you
      switch buffers with <tt>C-x b</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html">
    <tt>(info "(emacs)Minor Modes")</tt></a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you need help with a particular mode, <tt>C-h m</tt> describes the active
  major and minor modes. The mode description often lists important commands
  which are useful in that mode, which is helpful when you're learning to use a
  new mode.</p>

<h3>The minibuffer</h3>

<p>The minibuffer (the space at the bottom of the frame) is where Emacs prompts
  you for input in most situations: for a command, when you type <tt>M-x</tt>;
  for a file name, within <tt>M-x find-file</tt>; for an Elisp expression,
  within <tt>M-x eval-expression</tt>, etc. Here are some features common to
  most minibuffer prompts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use most buffer editing and movement commands. You can move
    around in, kill text from, and yank text to minibuffers.</li>
  <li>You can browse previous inputs to the current prompt using <tt>M-p</tt>
    and <tt>M-n</tt>.</li>
  <li>Tab completion is often available. For example, the <tt>M-x</tt> prompt
    offers tab completion, so you needn't worry about typing long command names
    like <tt>M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</tt> when <tt>M-x wdired-ch
    TAB</tt> suffices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for beginners</h2>

<h3>In the event of an emergency&hellip;</h3>

<p>Here's what to do if you've accidentally pressed a wrong key:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you executed a command and Emacs has modified your buffer,
    use <tt>C-/</tt> to undo that change.</li>
  <li>If you pressed a prefix key (e.g. <tt>C-x</tt>) or you invoked a command
    which is now prompting you for input (e.g. <tt>Find file: &hellip;</tt>),
    type <tt>C-g</tt>, repeatedly if necessary, to cancel.</li>
</ul>

<p><tt>C-g</tt> also cancels a long-running operation if it appears that Emacs

<h3>Keyboard and terminal setup</h3>

<p>Some Emacs users remap their Caps Lock key to act as an additional Ctrl key,
  because it is easier to reach. See
  <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MovingTheCtrlKey">instructions
  for moving Ctrl</a>.</p>

<p>Due to your keyboard or terminal configuration, you may find that some keys
  seem to do the wrong thing:</p>

<p>If your <tt>DEL</tt> key is not working (sometimes, typing <tt>DEL</tt>
  brings up a help screen, as if you typed <tt>C-h</tt>), try <tt>M-x
  normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</tt>.</p>

<p>If your meta key is not working, in order to type a key that contains meta,
  you can instead type <tt>ESC</tt>, then the remaining keys. For
  example, <tt>ESC x</tt> is the same as <tt>M-x</tt>, and <tt>ESC C-s</tt> is
  the same as <tt>C-M-s</tt>.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<p>Emacs comes with a FAQ which explains how to perform many commonly requested
  tasks; press <tt>C-h C-f</tt> to read it.</p>

<h2>Migrating to Emacs</h2>

<p>Emacs has a number of options for easing the transition from other editing
  environments.</p>

<h3>Emacs for Windows users</h3>

<p>In Windows, the bread and butter editing commands
  are <tt>C-z</tt>, <tt>C-x</tt>, <tt>C-c</tt>, and <tt>C-v</tt>.
  Unfortunately, these keys are frequently used in Emacs for other purposes
  (suspend, prefix key, prefix key, and next page). You can get those keys back
  for Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste by turning on "CUA mode" from the Options
  menu. CUA mode also lets you make a selection by using Shift in combination
  with movement keys, as you would do on Windows.</p>

<p>Since <tt>C-x</tt> and <tt>C-c</tt> are so integral to Emacs operation (they
  are prefix keys for many commands), CUA mode only binds <tt>C-x</tt>
  and <tt>C-c</tt> to Cut and Copy, respectively, when you have selected some
  text.</p>

<p>You can learn more about CUA mode by typing <tt>C-h f cua-mode RET</tt>.</p>

<h3>Emacs for vi/vim users</h3>

<p>Viper (<tt>M-x viper-mode</tt>) is a set of modes for emulating vi editing
  behavior in Emacs. It provides different levels of vi-adherence, depending on
  how vi-like you want your Emacs to be.</p>

<p>For more information about Viper,
  see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/viper/index.html">
    <tt>(info "(viper)")</tt></a>.</p>

<h2>Emacs resources</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html">GNU Emacs
    Manual</a> (<tt>C-h r</tt>) is the definitive guide if you want to learn
  more about Emacs. Some Emacs features have their
  own, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/">separate
    manuals</a> (<tt>C-h i d</tt>).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/efaq.html">GNU Emacs
    FAQ</a> (<tt>C-h C-f</tt>) answers many questions that beginners have about
  how Emacs works and how to set it up to do particular things.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org">EmacsWiki</a> contains information about
  many downloadable Emacs extensions, as well as tips for using and customizing
  Emacs.</p>

  the <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs">help-gnu-emacs
